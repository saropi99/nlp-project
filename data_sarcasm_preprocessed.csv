Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.

Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.

These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale.

1d5pdoi,"Brijesh Kumar Mishra, the main accused in a high-profile immigration scam involving fake offer letters from Canadian colleges, has pled guilty to three counts and has been sentenced to three years in prison.



Mishra, who was arrested by the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) on June 23, 2023, now faces approximately 19 months of imprisonment after accounting for time served, though he may be eligible for parole before completing the full term.



Mishra, who operated a firm called M/S Education Migration Services, was charged with multiple offenses under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. These included unauthorized representation, counselling misrepresentation, and aiding individuals to misrepresent or withhold material facts. The scam, which came to light in March 2023, affected hundreds of Indian students, primarily from Punjab, who were facing deportation from Canada after discovering that their offer letters were fake.



According to the CBSA, Mishra, who hails from Darbhanga in Bihar, was apprehended at an airport in British Columbia while attempting to enter Canada later years The charges laid against him stemmed from a comprehensive criminal investigation that revealed he had been offering immigration advice without a proper license and had been inducing clients to misrepresent information to Canadian authorities.



The court proceedings detailed Mishra’s actions between January 1, 2016, and February 12, 2020, during which he knowingly advised individuals in connection with immigration applications under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. His illegal activities were contrary to Section 91(1) of the Act and resulted in significant distress for many students and their families.



On March 17, 2023, Jalandhar police registered a case against Brijesh Kumar Mishra and his partners under sections 465, 467, 468, 471, and 120B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The investigation was later transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit. Additionally, the Jalandhar district authorities revoked the license of his consultancy.



Mishra charged an average of Rs 16 lakh from each student for visa-related services and college admissions. Upon the students’ arrival in Canada, Mishra would inform them that seats were unavailable at the colleges listed in the offer letters. He would then advise them to either seek admission at other colleges or wait for the next intake. In some instances, he returned the college fees, but in many cases, he did not.",0,british human mishka main accuse highprofile immigration scar involve face offer letter canadian college lead guilty three count sentence three year prison mishka arrest canadian border service agency case june face approximately month imprisonment account time serve though may eligible parole complete full term mishka operate firm call ms education migration service charge multiple offense immigration refugee protection act include unauthorized representation counsel misrepresentation aid individual misrepresent withhold material fact scar come light march affect hundred indian student primarily punjab face importation canada discover offer letter face accord case mishka nail darbhanga bear apprehend airport british columbia attempt enter canada later year charge lay stem comprehensive criminal investigation reveal offer immigration advice without proper license induce client misrepresent information canadian authority court proceeding detail mishka action january february know advised individual connection immigration application immigration refugee protection act illegal activity contrary section act result significant distress many student family march jalandhar police register case british human mishka partner section b indian penal code investigation later transfer antihuman trafficking unit additional jalandhar district authority revoke license consultant mishka charge average lake student isarelated service college admission upon student arrival canada mishka would inform seat available college list offer letter would advise either seek admission college wait next intake instance return college fee many case not,"['british', 'human', 'mishka', 'main', 'accuse', 'highprofile', 'immigration', 'scar', 'involve', 'face', 'offer', 'letter', 'canadian', 'college', 'lead', 'guilty', 'three', 'count', 'sentence', 'three', 'year', 'prison', 'mishka', 'arrest', 'canadian', 'border', 'service', 'agency', 'case', 'june', 'face', 'approximately', 'month', 'imprisonment', 'account', 'time', 'serve', 'though', 'may', 'eligible', 'parole', 'complete', 'full', 'term', 'mishka', 'operate', 'firm', 'call', 'ms', 'education', 'migration', 'service', 'charge', 'multiple', 'offense', 'immigration', 'refugee', 'protection', 'act', 'include', 'unauthorized', 'representation', 'counsel', 'misrepresentation', 'aid', 'individual', 'misrepresent', 'withhold', 'material', 'fact', 'scar', 'come', 'light', 'march', 'affect', 'hundred', 'indian', 'student', 'primarily', 'punjab', 'face', 'importation', 'canada', 'discover', 'offer', 'letter', 'face', 'accord', 'case', 'mishka', 'nail', 'darbhanga', 'bear', 'apprehend', 'airport', 'british', 'columbia', 'attempt', 'enter', 'canada', 'later', 'year', 'charge', 'lay', 'stem', 'comprehensive', 'criminal', 'investigation', 'reveal', 'offer', 'immigration', 'advice', 'without', 'proper', 'license', 'induce', 'client', 'misrepresent', 'information', 'canadian', 'authority', 'court', 'proceeding', 'detail', 'mishka', 'action', 'january', 'february', 'know', 'advised', 'individual', 'connection', 'immigration', 'application', 'immigration', 'refugee', 'protection', 'act', 'illegal', 'activity', 'contrary', 'section', 'act', 'result', 'significant', 'distress', 'many', 'student', 'family', 'march', 'jalandhar', 'police', 'register', 'case', 'british', 'human', 'mishka', 'partner', 'section', 'b', 'indian', 'penal', 'code', 'investigation', 'later', 'transfer', 'antihuman', 'trafficking', 'unit', 'additional', 'jalandhar', 'district', 'authority', 'revoke', 'license', 'consultant', 'mishka', 'charge', 'average', 'lake', 'student', 'isarelated', 'service', 'college', 'admission', 'upon', 'student', 'arrival', 'canada', 'mishka', 'would', 'inform', 'seat', 'available', 'college', 'list', 'offer', 'letter', 'would', 'advise', 'either', 'seek', 'admission', 'college', 'wait', 'next', 'intake', 'instance', 'return', 'college', 'fee', 'many', 'case', 'not']"

1d677tx,"Have you got the swift copy from the sender ? I am a PSB a banker and have worked in forex in another PSB for 6 years and one of the big issues we face in such of these remittances is that the payment is often stuck with intermediatory bank for various reasons . One of the major reason being the purpose of remittance is not clearly mentioned by the remitter. So intermediatory bank just keep them in their account and after some time simply return it to the sender.

So my suggestion is first obtain the swift copy from your remitter and then contact the Forex SBI Branch that deals with inward remittances and help them to sort it out.

While it's the responsibility of your base Branch to sort it out , the reality is most staffs in banks have zero understanding of froex and forex related transactions. So better to contact that forex Branch and ask them to track the payment from their **swift module** using your swift copy.

Then it will be easy to track the payment and give credit to your account.

It is more about the market and what make sense economically.

For example you can see construction cranes and material conveyor belt like things being used by bigger companies because that gives them cost optimisation and they're able to compete with other modernized players

Whereas if you go to smaller towns or to people who do smaller scale work, they still use old methods.

Why?
1) The new methods needs a lot of skills, time and patience to reach a level of competency required for giving the customer the same set of deliverables as they do now.


2) Financial incentive: It is often a large captial expense required to make the switch for smaller setups who may not have credit access. And since the demand for that kind of work doesn't reward extra for  it being done by any modern method , there's no incentive.


3) Risk taking ability. Every new migration comes with challenges. So for example if you want a small store owner to begin to track his inventory and make sales  using a cloud solution they won't be ready to face an outage or the prospect of paying more for security or similar upgrades because it doesn't add that much value compared to the cost

Everyone goes through all life phases, but here I am trying to give you some wisdom, and hopefully, you can use it to your advantage.

I was in a very similar situation growing up in a middle-class family.

Fast forward to a few months, he took his last breath in my arm, and neither of us said to each other how much we loved and cared for each other. 

We take things and people for granted and only realize their value when they are no longer around. 

The only way to solve your situation is for one party to compromise, and I know you would think they should learn the new ways because they are the elders, and you are the young ones. They should love you first. But that is not how it will work. You will need to talk to them with love and respect. Continue doing that, and one day, they will realize. Even if they don't, you will have no regrets later in your life.

Government has no business in doing business. Highways are not like telephone plans or insurance. Don't think they can just be privatised the same way. Building highways is not a business for the government. It is an expenditure on infrastructure. 

They could turn it into a profitable business and start selling monthly subscriptions and family plans for people to drive on the highways instead of setting up toll booths only at district borders or such.

2. Rafale's are in a league of their own, a few years ago french forces, claimed to have won a dogfight with f-22 raptor in a friendly exercise.
3. Russian jet engines are not as good as western counterparts. Although they are faster, they are a lot bulkier, bigger and have substantially more downtimes/ maintainance times than western jets and their engines.
4. Russian engines on an average last only 4000hrs while American ones last about 10-12k hours. (Not sure about rafale)
5. Rafal's are just a lot more reliable have better avionics etc. it makes sense

All the hi tech stuff, including the rails, is getting made by the Japanese. No one's learning any useful skills here, and there definitely isn't any tech transfer. 


>For clarity, JICA is funding 88% of the cost(1.25 lakh crore) which comes out to be 1.1 lakh crore. This amount is set to be repaid over 50 years at a 0.1% interest rate with repayments starting only after 15 years. This comes out to a yearly payment of 2000 crore.


Don't you think it's 2k cr per year too many, for a train that the pakoda mantri himself admits no one will take after the novelty wears off?


The train will cost way more than what the vast majority can afford. Just look at the substantially cheaper hagde bharat trains rubbing empty on routes that other trains run with overflowing passengers.  Those who can afford it will take it a couple of times when it's brand new, then realize that flying is faster and there's hardly any difference in cost. 


Then the boondoggle won't be able to recover its operational costs, forget about recovering the investment. Add the operational losses to the 2k cr.

1d15ww8,"OP. Here is my take on this. As any other person on this subreddit, you can choose to ignore this and go off on a tangent.

The problem about Hindu vs Muslims, is not one about religions. It is not about cultural practices either. It is nevermore so about the wrongs done by one community on other. The problem is, however, about isolation.

Think about your parents. How many Muslims on average do they interact with in a normal and very casual setting, say every day? Or let's say every week? Every month? Every year? In last 10 years of their lives?

The answer you will find is very few. There is very little exposure today. While the world is connected more so than ever, the exposure has decreased. So where do they get their exposure to form opinions about others? From media. And I am not talking about News media. I am talking about the entire media in general. Be it songs, movies, shows, art, literature, etc. Anyone who is forming their opinions, either in positive light or in negative light, they are doing so by exposing the themselves to these media.

Now, why is media so polarising? Is it because of politics? Well, that has always been true to a partial extent. Then is it because of apathy? That is essentially an outcome, isn't it? So it can't be that.

The answer to above will be the need for comfort. Majority population in every nation, in every era, in every region, has always been on a struggle to survive. In times past, the working hours were less, but the living conditions weren't so much. In times of current era, the living conditions have improved exponentially, but so have working hours and need for labour. All this leaves a common populace devoid of energy to look outside of what they find comfortable, be it in terms of opinions and thought process or in terms of experiences. And this is why they turn to media.

We have seen examples, countless many, that illustrate that people who are exposed to a widers variety of opinions and cultures are able to empathise more easily with others and be a tad bit more understanding.

But this exposure requires you to ensure you get exposed to both wrongs and rights of an idea or a culture. Simply being content with one side of a community or ideal will always make you blind to the other side and hamper a full understanding of why someone may stand on the opposite end of the empathy spectrum with respect to the idea or culture you support or stand against.

And all of this is individual effort. It is no one else's responsibility to ensure you are exposed to every facet of an idea or culture. No moral responsibility or ethical responsibility, lies on others to improve your understanding. You yourself are the sole heir of that responsibility. Others may sometimes come as a guide or helpers to point you in a direction.

Indian Muslims support Pakistan is a BJP propoganda. The first point is complete bullshit. Indian Muslims are regularly expected to prove their patriotism because of this bullshit propoganda.

Every religion is flawed and barbaric and people defend it. Christianity is based on human sacrifice. And hinduism has gems like the caste system and sati. 

>any other scholars come out and speak against their agenda of converting the entire world to one religion

An ideology cannot grow if it does not try to grow. All religions either do this or go extinct. That's how a religion works. Christians have missionaries that do the exact same thing. Hinduism does the same except it assimilates any and everything into hinduism. You worship a fish, that's fine, you worship a cow, that's fine, you eat fish and cow, that's fine too. That's the modern hinduism. Animal sacrifice is an essential part of Bengali Hindu culture, which would be unimaginable to a rajasthani veg Hindu. 

>But when I knew what holy books of the top 2 religions are teaching, my respect for Hinduism only grew more. 

I can bet you have not read the holy books of the top two religions. 
Christianity teaches ""In everything, do to others what you would have them do to you""
Islam teaches ""None of you will believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself.""

You can also accompany them so they don't get distanced from India and it seems like you have the financial capacity to support that. As for women's rights, it is wrong as it completely depends on the part of India. The main issue is rape and sexual harassment, but women absolutely can have successful careers in India. However, I do think it would be more difficult to convince your wife to move to India than your parents to move to the US, as your wife has a very antagonistic view of India that being in Canada myself, I find quite different from most other Indian diaspora people.

1d0z6w2,"OP:

Do you think that the times have remained unchanged? Society has evolved significantly, and it is essential to reconsider the focus of gender-centric schemes. These initiatives should now be targeted towards the specific sections of society that truly need them, rather than being broadly applied. This is because those who are already privileged often benefit the most, while those in genuine need remain underserved.


Recognizing the changing dynamics of our society is crucial. To ensure fairness and effectiveness, it is important to adapt our policies and programs to reflect the current realities. By focusing resources on those who truly need assistance, we can work towards achieving greater equity and inclusiveness. Additionally, continuous assessment and adjustment of these schemes can help address the evolving challenges faced by different sections of society.



I believe society has progressed to a stage where gender is no longer the primary ground for discrimination. Instead, financial capacity has become the more significant factor. A girl from a wealthy family is given all the opportunities, while a person from a poor family faces discrimination regardless of gender. 

While there are always exceptions, this trend generally holds true. 

It's important to recognize that socio-economic status plays a crucial role in determining access to opportunities. 

Therefore, policies and programs should focus more on bridging the financial gap to ensure that all individuals, regardless of their gender, have equal opportunities to succeed.

I think we have done this mistake in the past, we should try to avoid foreign companies for now. When our companies start producing cars, we can allow Tesla without much import tax so the competition to develop indigenous vehicles to be at par with Tesla. We should be exporting EVs soon.

My father can't walk properly because his knees have filled with water and needs operation as soon as possible, but still he gets warning letters to this day and threats that his salary will be deducted inspite of several medical proofs. He had to walk 5-6 kms to get to the polling booth in some very remote village in the Bardhaman district, with no proper water supply,  almost no sanitation, sometimes not even proper food for the night or fans. He gave up doing this job 3 years ago.

The previous year, the booth where my elder brother was the presiding officer, got attacked by some local goons with guns and knives in their hands. They took the voting machines and went away, and locked my elder brother and 5 other booth workers in a dark room with no windows and fans, no food and water. My elder brother called the police, but the police said that they won't be able to lodge a complaint as the goons have made a settlement with them.

1bqsr48,"The whole concept of “hate speech” is Orwellian and goes against the very tenets of liberalism, unless someone is making direct threats then they should not be prosecuted in any way for what they say, not only is it morally wrong to criminalise speech, but it is also foolish from an intellectual and humanitarian standpoint, ideas should be fought with ideas, that is the cornerstone of a liberal democracy and it’s the best way we can help people change, its using a carrot rather than a stick.

Personally I think it's absolutely insane this is even being discussed. What should be happening is that income tax bands move upwards specifically to benefit people who are cash poor.

The reasons why removing this tax is insane:
- It primarily benefits wealthy pensioners. It's a massive gaping hole through which cash rich people will funnel money if they can just take gigantic tax free pension payments in year 1 of their retirement
- shifts even more tax burden to young people, who provably have higher living expenses (rent, transport, student loans) than most all pensioners.
- Young people probably won't get the same deal as pension age gets yanked out of reach.

But as a time traveller from the past (i.e. I’m an old woman), I can totally remember *decades* of my life when women were blamed for being attacked. Raped during army training? “What would she expect, trying to be a soldier?”. Raped in the town centre? “What was she wearing?” Raped in a car park? “Well, it was her fault going out after dark”. (This literally happened to a colleague of mine in our company car park after work. This -and worse- was openly said to her).

Being “openly a woman” in a host of different everyday situations was just “asking” to be attacked. We hear less of that now-although I think a lot of women suspect that many police officers still think this way. But to spread this kind of openly prejudiced speech to racial/ethnic/religious groups, seems to be a rarer thing.

1bif54z,"Trigger warning: I’ve lost respect for the profession. The information they pedal is mostly out of date and harmful and is designed to generate revenue for pharmaceutical companies. 

I followed their advice for 8 years to treat depression, an autoimmune disorder and Costochondritis. All that happened was I got worse. 

They told me the Costochondritis was a ‘systemic inflammation disorder’. Turns out it’s not at all. It is in fact a hinge seizure and is mechanical in nature, with the inflammation being a byproduct. Physio to mobilise the joint was the solution and worked in a matter of weeks. If I’d continued listening to my GP I’d still have it, as many do. 

My GP was extremely happy to prescribe handfuls of pills that made me significantly worse but refused to approve my diet following years of personal research. 

After 18 months of eating right, I went back for a check up. ALL of my symptoms are gone and I’m healthier than I’ve ever been. Cholesterol, BP, blood volume, hormone regulation, artery health etc are all the best they’ve ever been and all I did was stop eating most carbs, processed food and instead ate plenty of red meat.

Wanting to help people is genuinely honourable and I appreciate their intent, but I don’t really want to fund misinformation anymore. There are many people in my position who haven’t been able to figure it out. It’s time the health system got on board with actually improving health, with the help of real data, rather than merely selling products with studies paid for by the producers designed for maximum profit.

I'd love to be able to assume that the police wouldn't set a dog on someone without good reason.

Unfortunately, that's not an assumption I'm confident making.

I think it's very plausible that a small proportion of police officers would be happy to set a dog on someone in an act of performative revenge.

I wish none of this was so. It's a tragedy. But police behaviour in the UK has not been wonderful for a long time and the result is a lack of confidence in their good behaviour.

The fact that this guy might be an absolute scumbag is irrelevant. It's the job of the courts to pass sentence, not the police. If they're shown to have acted properly, so be it.

The plan itself, to send them to another country for processing isn't actually illegal so they should be able to find a safe country to do this.

Simply declaring Rwanda officially safe is insane, particularly as there are Rwandan refugees fleeing from Rwanda who have applied for asylum in the UK.

The Home office won't talk about this, but i suspect that the finances won't stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the UK taxpayer has financed those Rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that Cruella Slaverman admired so much.

Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit £3 trillion. (£3,000,000,000,000).
It was about £1.1 trillion in 2010 when they took over.

He was a bit shocked (like wow) but then looked at me and his face changed to confused looking, so I said *“oh no…are you not Spanish?”*

He replied *“no I’m from Brazil…but?…so?… you’re not Portuguese”*
I didn’t understand what he meant though so I asked him why he thought I was Portuguese.

He said *“your pronunciation was 100% Portuguese it sounded native so I was excited to have a colleague who was a Portuguese speaker but then I turned to see a small English girl (thanks) and you don’t even look 1/2 Portuguese it make no sense to me! Your *hola* in Spanish was pronounced very very wrong, but for Portuguese it’s perfect, I’m impressed!”*

We had a bit of a slow start this year, but this month we are getting ‘summer’ level of sales, both in decking and cladding, which is something that none of us really expected.

Bates interjected by asking what the minister tells pregnant women during those periods the hospital was shut. 'Cross your legs?' she asked

1csf5w3,"Bail is now trying to predetermine guilt by using profiling characteristics.

In my opinion, if you want to minimise deprivation of freedom and maximise security of the public, you have to find a measure that accomplishes both without predetermining the outcome of the judicial process: that means detention in a secure hotel with all conventional freedoms provided except leaving the premises and a protection detail on the accused home to prevent taking advantage of the situation. We could even combine court accommodation in a separate part of the building.

If it was not an emergency 5 years ago or even 1 year ago, it is not a national emergency now when crime is steadily falling. It's simply not possible to get to zero crime and whilst we should try to minimise crime, events will still happen like the stabbing of 5 people at Bondi: it's a tragedy, but it doesn't represent an emergency.

I believe this is all stemming from idiotic legislation on indefinite detention and equally idiotic lack of a legal alternative.

I also don't understand how the High Court can suddenly strike down legislation after years of inaction and result in a compromised security of the public as government rushes to implement emergency legislation as a knee-jerk and compromised solution. Surely the High Court could advise government of a likely challenge sufficiently in advance to permit well-thought out legislation to be put in place before striking down legislation and putting the public at risk, especially since this was about indefinite detention and nothing had been done up to that point.

1cpqqgf,"Rebecca Huntley assesses the public mood for a living. Right now, she says, it is grim, and the housing crisis is at the root of it.

“You actually can’t have a conversation about anything in any focus group about any topic that doesn’t begin and end with housing. There is a deep, almost intractable despair,” says Huntley, director at the strategic communications consultancy 89 Degrees East.

The way people in her focus groups see it, she says, “it doesn’t matter whether interest rates are up or interest rates are down, or unemployment is up or unemployment is down, doesn’t matter if it’s a pandemic, not a pandemic, GFC or not a GFC, housing is a horror show”.

To an ever-increasing extent, they see just one solution to their woes: cut immigration.

“They’re like, ‘We can’t get ourselves out of this mess, therefore, we just need less people lining up for the rental property, less people trying to buy the house. Just less people’,” says Huntley.

It’s not such a new sentiment, though perhaps not previously so keenly felt. Opinion polls have consistently shown over many years that a substantial majority of Australians want a smaller migrant intake and a significant number want a much smaller intake. One poll last year found as many as a quarter of respondents wanted zero net migration.

Pauline Hanson reeled off the results of 11 of these polls, conducted over the past six years, in a speech to parliament in March.

Of course, Hanson has been railing against immigration since she was first elected to federal parliament back in 1996, famously warning in her first speech that Australia was being “swamped by Asians”. Two decades later, after having lost her seat in the lower house, she made a triumphant return as a senator for Queensland in 2016, warning Australia was being “swamped by Muslims”.

In her March 21 speech, though, Hanson focused less on matters of race and religion than on the pressures of the sheer number of migrants on housing, transport, health, education and other services. In reciting the findings of various reputable pollsters, she claimed vindication. The major parties and big media had called her a racist and ignored her warnings that the numbers were “out of control”.

“Was I right?” she asked her fellow senators. “You’d never admit it, but yes I was,” she said.

It’s hard to think of any issue other than immigration on which public opinion has been so at odds with accepted policy for so long. The large majority of people want it cut; the great majority of the political, media and economic establishment have ignored their concerns.

It has long been the multipartisan political position that high immigration is a good thing, enriching the nation culturally and economically. Questioning the orthodoxy has been a reputationally dangerous act, leading many people and organisations to be reluctant to share their qualms about the size of Australia’s immigration intake.

Ian Lowe, emeritus professor in the School of Environment and Science at Griffith University, can attest to that.

Lowe was president of the country’s pre-eminent environmental organisation, the Australian Conservation Foundation, for 10 years until 2014.

During that time, he tells *The Saturday Paper*, he advocated for the ACF to “prosecute the idea that population growth was a significant environmental pressure”. The organisation was reluctant to take a position, however, on the basis that advocating for a lower intake would be “taken as a sort of Pauline Hanson-type racist comment”.

“Cutting migration will make housing cheaper, but it would also make us poorer … The boost to government budgets is enormous.”

So the ACF avoided the issue, and it still does today – as do most other civil society groups concerned with environmental and social justice issues.

Meanwhile, Australia’s population is on track to grow to about 40 million people – an increase equivalent to the combined current populations of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane – by 2060.",0,rebecca

The only bit I can find:

>“We are a racist country, let’s face it. We always have been and it’s very depressing,”

There’s no metric on what qualifies as a ‘racist’ country or not; but it is obvious that racism has played a part in the national psyche and conversation.

The treatment of massacres of indigenous people pre 1901

The fact the first Federal Parliament passed the White Australia Policy, a blatantly racist law which remained in law for 70 years, the majority of Australia’s existence up until this time

The practice of forced removal of children from parents of only one race again for the majority of the nation’s existence (again up until the 70s)

Fearmongering and dogwhistling against non white races being prominent in political discourse even up until today.

Different legislation for those living in indigenous communities (like NT alcohol laws) 

On a non political level (as her comment didn’t specifically mention politics only):

The vast vast majority of commercial TV and media featuring white faces. Today 1 out of 5 Australians are of Asian heritage (there’s more Australians of Asian heritage than Americans of black or Latino heritage) but you wouldn’t know it from watching Australian TV.

The national character and story being almost exclusively from a white Anglo Saxon perspective, with only fleeting mentions of a vague ‘multiculturalism’.

News media quick to label the race of a non white offender but you never hear the opposite.

News media egging on race riots like Cronulla.

Tingle is right, racism is a big part of the Australian story. Australia may not be as racist as other nations, and we may have improved the situation in recent years but neither of those facts invalidate her comments.

1d2h47p,"TL:DR 

Get financial advice asap. Yesterday would be better. 

Centrelink are useless. 

Quality of care varies from day to day. Visit and be your mum’s advocate. 



I was the same as you, and retired as well, with hours on my hands each day. Both mum and dad went in together, owning their home and with some cash investments. It’s a nightmare!

Here are my pro-tips!

*If your mother has assets like a family home and money in the bank, then pay for financial advice from someone who specialises in the field. They will do detailed scenarios and calculations which will let you determine what you need to do financially. It may be to sell the house, it may be to rent the house and pay interest costs etc. 

From memory it cost about $3500. 

They also offered an annual fee of $1500 or so to deal with all the Centrelink and nursing home stuff that occurs each year. I knocked that bit back. How hard can it be? Dumb decision, at least for the first 12 months. 

*Centrelink have no idea. I repeat, they have no idea. And just when you think you have it sorted, you realise again, that they have no idea. 

You will need to spent hours on the phone waiting, and days and weeks and months following them up to make sure that they have got things right. 

Because I had financial advice I knew what mum and dad should be paying, 85% of the full age pension plus $25 a day each in means tested care fees. It took me 13 months of dealing with Centrelink to get to that stage. We are finally there. 

I actually had to tell them what they were doing wrong each step of the way. But actually getting them to fix it was a nightmare. 

I’ve just paid $8000 in back fees even though they are the ones who messed up. And let’s not forget the 6 weeks where they charged $168 dollars a day each because someone added an extra zero when inputting the nursing home deposit. There is a significant difference between a deposit of $550000 and $5500000 when it comes to fees! 

*Aged Care - family visits are a must. If staff know that there is a chance that someone may pop in to see your mum, I can guarantee that she will be cared for in a more timely manner. 

Homes are short staffed, overworked and subject to so much red tape that it’s surprising that they function. Even the best ones have good and bad days depending on which staff are available. 

Ask around and find the good ones, but realise even then, that some times you will be disappointed in them. 

Be your mum’s advocate. That’s the key word. Use it when you speak to management, which you will,  I guarantee. It’s enshrined in the aged care charter of rights. 

That said, I’ve found most staff to be excellent, pleasant and caring,  but they can only do so much if they are under- resourced. 

Good luck.

The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese ­government’s handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.

Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.
“Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won’t change this direction and why he won’t change it immediately,” Mr Tehan said.
“What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister’s own making.”

Mr Giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to Saki, and criticised the AAT’s decision to reinstate Saki’s visa as “inconsistent” with Direction 99.

How can domestic violence be a valid priority when more women and children die on the roads, if indeed death is the primary determinant of the program?

I'm assuming they mean women in Victoria rather than Victorian women (from the Victorian era) none of whom are still alive.

It's deceitful to blather on about number of deaths of women in domestic violence as justification, when more women die in other arenas, in order to support a program that aims to reduce domestic violence of a wide range of forms including raised voices.

Surely the focus should be on the worst triaged objective outcomes, not subjective hurt feelings; and on men who kill, not profiling all men for the actions of a minority.

1cxlqov,"Gas runs out. It produces ongoing waste. It's sourced from a small number of places, with a small number of providers. The price can rise incredibly sharply when policies (national, state, or corporate) change. Supply can be cut off.

Renewables don't run out - that's their whole point. They don't, in general, produce ongoing waste of multiple types from their point of production to their point of use, or at least it's significantly less than fossil fuels or nuclear. The production equipment is either highly recyclable or likely to be able to become so as technology advances. And because renewable power can be produced by thousands of companies, and even in-house by businesses and individuals, it's a lot harder for prices to do anything but go down per watt-hour, even on initial equipment costs. It's not controlled by a small number of providers. It doesn't need large-scale and separate infrastructure (of a kind significantly different to the existing electrical grid) to be maintained. It doesn't need things continually physically transported in order to operate. And it's a lot harder to cut off supply when more end-consumers are producing at least some of their needs themselves and can source the rest extremely locally.

The only two reasons to go with non-renewables are (1) price per watt-hour, and (2) politics from people who want to make all the money and/or have control over fuel supplies. And the first reason is rapidly approaching a non-issue, especially if you factor in total cleanup and waste-management costs from every aspect of the operational process.

Previously, the first reason held economic sway, and it made sense to go with non-renewables. I'm not about to point fingers at people who made that decision at the time. But it's becoming far less of one, and increasingly likely to swing over to renewables on larger scales than it already has, over time.",0,gas run produce go waste source small number place small number provide price rise incredibly sharply policy national state corporate change supply cut renewables not run whole point not general produce go waste multiple type point production point use least significantly less fossil feel nuclear production equipment either highly recyclable likely able become technology advance renewal power produce thousand company even inhouse business individual lot hard price anything go per watthour even initial equipment cost not control small number provide not need largescale separate infrastructure kind significantly different exist electrical grid maintain not need thing continually physically transport order operate lot hard cut supply endconsumers produce least need source rest extremely locally two reason go nonrenewables price per watthour politics people want make money andor control fuel supply first reason rapidly approach nonissue especially factor total clean wastemanagement cost every aspect operational process previously first reason hold economic sway make sense go nonrenewables not point finger people make decision time become far less one increasingly likely swing renewables large scale already time,"['gas', 'run', 'produce', 'go', 'waste', 'source', 'small', 'number', 'place', 'small', 'number', 'provide', 'price', 'rise', 'incredibly', 'sharply', 'policy', 'national', 'state', 'corporate', 'change', 'supply', 'cut', 'renewables', 'not', 'run', 'whole', 'point', 'not', 'general', 'produce', 'go', 'waste', 'multiple', 'type', 'point', 'production', 'point', 'use', 'least', 'significantly', 'less', 'fossil', 'feel', 'nuclear', 'production', 'equipment', 'either', 'highly', 'recyclable', 'likely', 'able', 'become', 'technology', 'advance', 'renewal', 'power', 'produce', 'thousand', 'company', 'even', 'inhouse', 'business', 'individual', 'lot', 'hard', 'price', 'anything', 'go', 'per', 'watthour', 'even', 'initial', 'equipment', 'cost', 'not', 'control', 'small', 'number', 'provide', 'not', 'need', 'largescale', 'separate', 'infrastructure', 'kind', 'significantly', 'different', 'exist', 'electrical', 'grid', 'maintain', 'not', 'need', 'thing', 'continually', 'physically', 'transport', 'order', 'operate', 'lot', 'hard', 'cut', 'supply', 'endconsumers', 'produce', 'least', 'need', 'source', 'rest', 'extremely', 'locally', 'two', 'reason', 'go', 'nonrenewables', 'price', 'per', 'watthour', 'politics', 'people', 'want', 'make', 'money', 'andor', 'control', 'fuel', 'supply', 'first', 'reason', 'rapidly', 'approach', 'nonissue', 'especially', 'factor', 'total', 'clean', 'wastemanagement', 'cost', 'every', 'aspect', 'operational', 'process', 'previously', 'first', 'reason', 'hold', 'economic', 'sway', 'make', 'sense', 'go', 'nonrenewables', 'not', 'point', 'finger', 'people', 'make', 'decision', 'time', 'become', 'far', 'less', 'one', 'increasingly', 'likely', 'swing', 'renewables', 'large', 'scale', 'already', 'time']"

1d0r77q,"I'm in a strata as a renter and tbh I'm okay with it. 

During the really bad flooding situation we had a few years back, my apartment flooded due to there being no flashing at all in my external wall to my private courtyard (owners responsibility) and also the external wall that the driveway is on (strata responsibility). And I'm talking 2inches deep in my apartment removing access to my loungeroom and kitchen. Also inadequate drainage in my courtyard which helped make it even worse according to the guys who xame to fix it.

My landlord (owner) decided that because it was unprecedented flooding they wouldn't be fixing the wall to my courtyard, that it was fine and likely wouldn't happen again, while strata was prepping to fix the driveway side. This caused an argument between the two as technically strata would have to rip apart some of my internal walls to ensure the flashing was fixed and for of course... Mold checks. One of the other issues I had was my courtyard is 2ft below the road level and I only had the one drain, which wasn't effective to stop water pooling, so that + absolutely no flashing and the courtyard being under water so far the weep holes (I think that's what they called them) were under the water.. so the water only had one way to drain. Into my apartment. 

Strata ripped away ALL the walls affected to redo the flashing, including in the courtyard, had 2 more drains added to my courtyard and then took the owners to court to pay for the repairs to their part of the wall and the new drainage as my strata saw it rightly as unreasonable to not fix the other part of the issue. Took the lovely workers 3 days to do it all including repainting the inside walls they had to pull apart to fix it. 

We had a very similar flooding incident this year, strata were all over me to check the flashing was working, there was nothing coming into my apartment and even sent an inspector out to just... Check via little holes they fixed the same week. 

And look, while it was unprecedented flooding, it still was absolutely not okay for my apartment to 3xs in 6mths end up 2inches under water. And there was time between each event to fix it, clearly as it was done in 3 days total. 

Others can I guess be absolute shit shows, but not all are.

Edit to add: ours is a corporate style strata, no owners are on their board or whatever it is. They are a management of the property style set up. Owners can bitch at them/ask them to do repairs to common area, but owners have to accept anything really they say, unless totally unreasonable.

1ctzm63,"You're quite wrong on all fronts, which is consistent for your take on this matter but I'll explain. Again.

Genocide is a *jus cogens* offence. As such, the Australian state cannot punish it; it has a solemn duty to prevent it but that's it. South Africa, in a bold move to distract ANC critics at home (when electoral woes were headed their way) sought to make a case for it in the ICJ, and that ruling has been ignorantly and wilfully interpreted since. 

**Our** obligation under the convention is for the prevention, though. **Not** the punishment. Some objective research would have illustrated why, and I'll have to explain it for you because of the pesky ""objective"" part.

The first jus cogens trial, for which our own Doc Evatt was not involved (but he was in UNGAR 181, fun fact), was the Nuremberg trials. Here, the new German government did not punish the old, nor did the US take the lead. A tribunal was convened with a panel of Allied judges. 

When the Rwandan genocide went to trial, it was at a UN-backed [International Tribunal]( Similarly, when the Serbian leadership went on trial for the genocide committed in the Yugoslav wars, it was via a UN international tribunal ([ICTY]( 

This is not coincidence. It is a function of a jus cogens offence, because as opposed to the application of jus commune in the domestic courts, no state can permit any derogation from this norm nor validly punish it. In other words, you can *only* have an international legal trial.

1d4jj8u,"I’ll give you a quick breakdown of dating apps in Melbourne; 

-Plenty of fish; more like plenty of bots

-OkCupid; Crazy expensive dodgy dating app that matches you with 8-9 invisible profiles from Africa and asks you to pay $90 to see where they are from. OkCupid used to be a safe haven for people from all walks of life, match.com bought it and drove it to ground.

-Tinder: most users are Instagram and TikTok influencer wannabes posing in filtered photos with their tongues out drinks in their hands, asking people to entertain them. Rest are 40+ single parents with Snapchat filtered photos and anger management issues 

- Feeld; Like Tinder only worse, Lot of torso pictures, short attention span, no interest for relationships, great majority are either after hookups or they have no idea what they are looking for (this is literally what people write) admittedly there are some interesting people on Feeld but there is also so much rubbish, bots and spammers and unstable folks that you lose interest combing through shit very quickly. 

-Bumble; you are more likely to make friends there through BFF option than anything else, less bots as app is better regulated but clientele tends to be more white collar and elitists there, would you like to choose between a real estate agent with character issues or a business owner that looks down on blue collar people? 

I erased all of these a while ago, it was exhausting. 

My suggestion is that get out there and meet people through socializing; meetup app is amazing to build friend circles, don’t use it to date, it’s frowned upon but once you get out there you’ll meet people anyway. 

There is everything from mental health support groups to mindfulness practices, hiking groups to book clubs. 

I am an introvert so it’s perfect app to find my crowd, dating apps were literally torturing my soul. 

I am not single luckily, I wouldn’t want to be single in this internet age, it brought out the worst in people. 

There are plenty of men in dating scene who are convinced women wants to see them naked or their private parts, and there are also women who know there are many desperate men so they treat men like trained monkeys who should roll on command, it’s so toxic.

\* project teams that move directly to the next project in the queue when their current one winds up

\* long term rollover contracts for ongoing service provision

1d5vino,"Having been proven correct with respect of the actual jus cogens offences at play in this war (CAH, war crimes) and being told by very, *very* Online people how I was wrong at it was all the fashionable crime starting with G - which the ICC neglected to indict upon, suggesting jews I mean AKSHULLY zionists! do control the world - I'm really keen to see how my international law major stacks up against people who have a Bachelor's in TikTokPoliSci from Reddit University!

Conceptually, the idea that no state's leaders can be immune to prosecution from *jus cogens* offences is one that, even in spite of the views of some states like China and the US, holds water. We have agreed that in customary international law and through some treaty law, that no state is permitted to derogate from the peremptory norms of international law - which, in lay speak, means no state can justify one of these crimes by saying that the sovereign state made it legal. The sovereign state cannot make it legal, which is the main reason why America struggles with the concept, because of their own take on Constitutional jurisprudence. The ICC sought, in a sense, to manage this by targeting individuals (the ICJ focuses on disputes between states) because generally one or more senior figures in a group or regime are responsible for the policy that leads to these crimes. Entire semesters on international legal jurisdictional theory was devoted to how the US views, and makes use of, the different types of jurisdiction in international law.

So we're getting to the intersection of the practice and the theory. In practice, the US also raised the prospect of misuse of the court's authority on political grounds, where the politics of statecraft get in the way and the court becomes a blunt instrument of vengeance, not justice. The way the ICC handled this does give that complaint some credit. For one; in trying to give an appearance of balance, Prosecutor Khan made a false equivalence by inferring that the leaders of a radical terrorist group are equal to leaders of a democratically elected state. As flawed as those leaders are, it is a gross violation of protocol to give them false equivalence and pandered *entirely* to politics in doing so. The calculus was that the pressure would be less to defy convention and equate the two than issue warrants for the likes of Mohammed Deif and Yayha Sinwar first and incur the wrath of the useful idiocy movement.

The ICC's investigators were also due to meet with officials from the government of Israel, as part of their investigations. It was arranged and never followed through on. Under the ICC charter, if a state is investigating its own for the commission of a jus cogens offence, then the ICC will defer any acts until such a time as the investigation was over. It is of course, doubtful to the point of fantasy to believe Israel would self-investigate on these grounds - but a court like this *must* be strict in its observing of protocol, if it is to have legitimacy in any meaningful sense. The US, Russia, and China all already are in opposition to the concept, which is 60% of the Permanent members of the UN Security Council. International cooperation has died for less (see also: League of Nations, and US non-involvement).

This brings us to Australia. The opt-out clause Dutton refers to exists for the US, and this situation - though it's hard to see Bibi coming here. It should exist. Dutton, on a diplomatic front, is right to suggest we avail ourselves of it. But there's a wider argument, which Dutton is missing, and that's not the first time I've had to say this about the LOTO.

Israel is right to view this war as an existential crisis. It is right to view 7 October as unacceptable. It is right to view the legions of useful morons parroting HAMAS talking points and confidently saying they're too smart for propaganda, as an existential threat as the rhetoric only gets more and more aligned to radical Islamic views of Jewish people. 

It is **not** right, however, to carry out collective punishment under international law.

Australia's correct path has been trodden by the Albanese government, despite unhelpful, performative, and stupid opposition from the Liberals and Greens alike. Reaffirm ally status with Israel. Ask Israel to observe its international obligations at law. Hold it to account as we would *any* liberal democracy that falls short of the standards, whilst also worshipping at the altar of Moynihan's Law as our left so ably does. **But also suggest that where the ICC is concerned, the legal case is valid and that Australia will only ever consider extraditing** ***after*** **Mohammed Deif, Yiyha Sinwar, and Mohammed al Masri have been locked up in den Haag.** 

There is less pressure on Qatar to hand these billionaire religious racists over, these cowards who make America's Koch brothers look lovely and secular. That has to change, and if Israeli leaders are tried where HAMAS leaders are not, it makes a mockery of the whole system. Saying as such should be without controversy.

So, like many things, Dutton is a little bit right, but it's purely by accident; he doesn't know why or how, and it's grossly offset by how wrong he is too.",1,prove correct respect actual cohens

He was a Keynesian. Meaning he used government spending to maintain full employment. When inflation increased he raised taxes to reduce it. 
When inflation was low; government spending was used to lower unemployment.

The NSW Coalition’s most senior law officer, Alister Henskens, has been accused of displaying a “dereliction of duty” after he tried to rush new domestic violence bail laws through the state parliament before even reading the bill.

In an extraordinary move, Henskens wanted to suspend standing orders so the Minns government’s new laws, which include the removal of the presumption of bail for serious domestic violence offenders, would pass without consultation.

The changes follow a string of high-profile alleged domestic violence offences, including the death of Forbes woman Molly Ticehurst last month.

The bill had not yet been tabled to parliament when Henskens, the shadow attorney-general, argued that there was no time to waste in toughening bail laws. He later said he had seen the government’s press release outlining the changes and knew the bill would not be controversial or lengthy.

Henskens said the laws had been modelled on a bill proposed by the Coalition, and the shadow cabinet had agreed to support Labor’s laws.

However, Henskens’ push failed when Sydney MP Alex Greenwich and Greens MP for Newtown Jenny Leong delivered a blistering attack.

Greenwich said he had been in parliament for “five premiers, five leaders of the opposition and four different parliaments”, and he had never seen a proposal with “such disrespect to stakeholders in this space”.

“I’ve never seen a greater dereliction of duty of an opposition to not even look at a bill, or greater disrespect for stakeholders to say you don’t want to consult with them,” Greenwich said.
“They want to rubber stamp something they haven’t ever seen. But let me say this to the stakeholders and those concerned: if the opposition are going to abrogate their responsibility in this space, the crossbench will pick it up.”

Leong said the former Coalition government had 12 years to improve domestic violence rates but did little to increase vital funding for emergency measures, such as shelters for women fleeing partners.

She said Henskens’ attempts to ram through the bill smacked of “relevance deprivation”.

Leader of the House Ron Hoenig said it was completely reckless of the Coalition to push through the laws without having any idea of what they said.

“The bill could be to abolish the Liberal Party,” Hoenig said.
Attorney-General Michael Daley told parliament that the NSW Police Force had requested time to ensure that “all their systems and officers are ready to implement these changes across the state”.
Domestic violence support groups, including Say No to Violence, had also asked that the new laws be “considered properly” before being passed.

On Tuesday, the Minns government announced a series of sweeping changes designed to make it harder for men accused of serious domestic violence offences to be released back into the community.
At the centre of the package is a reversal of the presumption of bail against men accused of serious domestic violence offences, which includes intimate partner violence involving elements such as sexual assault, strangulation, kidnapping or coercive control.

There will also be changes that will allow bail decisions on serious domestic violence offences to be delayed while prosecutors appeal an offender’s release in the Supreme Court.

A requirement for magistrates and judges to consider “red flag” behaviour such as animal cruelty, stalking and verbal or physical abuse when considering bail will be introduced, while courts will need to consider the views of victims and their families.",0,paywall coalition senior law officer blister henskens accuse display dereliction duty try rush new domestic violence bail law state parliament

1cveo31,"A private consulting firm handed almost $10 million in aged-care contracts has left providers and the federal government embarrassed after it disabled websites built with taxpayer money, delivered a 13-page final report and issued legal threats.

The saga of Miles Morgan Australia’s involvement in the “Future Fit” turnaround project for Meals on Wheels is emblematic of a broader crisis in aged care, where departmental officials and ministers throw money at the private sector hoping to fix a social problem.

It is also a cautionary tale in contract management that has earnt the attention of the acting auditor-general, Rona Mellor.

Miles Morgan Australia (MMA) is a boutique consulting and research services firm that was owned and operated out of Western Australia from 2012 by Barbara Macnish, a signatory to the first two contracts under the Future Fit program alongside her then chief executive officer, Lakshman Gunaratnam, a former Deloitte Australia partner.

Macnish sold the business to Gunaratnam just days after the second contract was signed in December 2022 and he took control as sole director four days before Christmas that year.

Together with former Labor adviser Loire Hunter, Gunaratnam owns the company through another vehicle, Leveraged Pty Ltd.

Miles Morgan Australia’s involvement with Meals on Wheels began in May 2021, when the Morrison government announced changes to the Commonwealth Home Support Program that would eventually combine lower-level care with more intensive care in a new category called the Support at Home Program.

Meals on Wheels Australia was approached by MMA with the offer of pro bono advice and the two outfits worked together on a business transformation funding proposal for the national peak body of Meals on Wheels providers. Meals on Wheels Australia had asked the Department of Health and Aged Care for $5.5 million.

The government approved but, without the knowledge of Meals on Wheels Australia, the department recommended to then aged care services minister Richard Colbeck that it should give the money directly to MMA because it had already been working with the meals network, had “a deep understanding” of the needs and a “strong working relationship with the Department”.

“This puts MMA in a unique position to deliver on the Department’s requirements,” the submission prepared for Colbeck says.

“This procurement was through a direct approach (one supplier) of MMA under an existing panel arrangement.”

Despite this plain fact in the ministerial submission, which was not public information until it was ordered to be tabled in the senate by Greens Senator Janet Rice, the contract notice for the $5.5 million first phase of MMA work still states the process was conducted as an “open tender”.

That contract was later revised up to more than $7 million. The Saturday Paper is not suggesting that MMA or any of its directors have acted improperly in discharging their obligations under the federal government contract.

Within months of winning the contract, MMA decided Meals on Wheels Australia did not have the “capability” for the transformation work and the national body was sidelined. Instead, some state associations were chosen to participate.",0,private consulting firm hand almost million agedcare contract leave provide federal government embarrass disable webster build taxpayer

Police minister Anthony Carbines has been forced to admit he misled parliament amid the [worsening police pay crisis.](

In what is threatening to ­become the biggest schism ­between the force and the state in more than a decade, Victoria Police remains locked in a [bitter stalemate with the Police Association]( over a push to ­introduce nine-hour shifts for frontline officers.

Appearing before a parliamentary inquiry on Tuesday, Mr Carbines emphatically denied being a signatory to a deed between the state government, Victoria Police and the Police Association of Victoria, in which they agreed to implement the new rostering model, which would also see officers work nine-day fortnights, providing it didn’t incur ­additional costs or require extra resources.

“I don’t think you’ll find my signature on pieces of paper that relate to the parties, being Victoria Police and the Police Association, they are the parties to the deed, an agreement to commit themselves to work on these matters with the assistance and the leadership of the mediator,” Mr Carbines said.

“That process continues and while that process is under way, it’s not appropriate for the government or minister to intervene or interfere.”

But the state government later confirmed Mr Carbines had indeed signed the deed on December 20 last year, a day after the Police Association ­announced a “breakthrough”.

Mr Carbines later admitted to being confused by the line of questioning by Nationals MP Danny O’Brien, a veteran of the public accounts and estimates committee probing this month’s state budget.

Mr O’Brien said the police pay deal was critical to the committee’s work because Chief Commissioner Shane Patton, who is vehemently opposed to the introduction of nine-hour shifts, has claimed it would add $3bn to the force’s annual wages bill.

He has also warned it would force the closure of police stations and take up to 2400 police off the beat and undermine community safety – a claim vehemently denied by the police union.

“The impression I was getting from the question that was being asked was that somehow signing the deed was determining the outcome, or obliging parties on the way in which they had to negotiate,” Mr Carbines said.

“The deed simply sets the parameters through which the parties have agreed to have a dialogue and a discussion, it was certainly not a task for me to sign a deed that directs or confirms the way in which this enterprise agreement has to be determined.” Shadow police minister Brad Battin slammed Mr Carbines, who is also Minister for Racing. “When you have a minister more focused on horse racing than police, of course he can’t explain his mistakes,” he said. “Anthony Carbines is either totally incompetent, or intentionally misleading parliament. Either way, he is failing those he pretends to represent.”",1,anthony caries fire admit confuse line questioning draw criticism either totally incompetent intentionally misleading parliament police minister anthony caries force admit mislead parliament amid worsen police pay crisis threaten become big schism between force state decade victoria police remain lock bitter stalemate police association push introduce ninehour shift frontline officer appear parliamentary inquiry tuesday mr caries emphatically deny signature deed state government victoria police police association victoria agree implement new fostering model would also see officer work nineday fortnight provide not incur additional cost require extra resource not think find signature piece paper relate party victoria police police association party deed agreement commit work matter assistance leadership mediator mr caries say process continue process way not appropriate government minister intervene interfere state government later confirm mr caries indeed sign deed december last year day police association announced breakthrough mr caries later admit confuse line question national dandy brief veteran public account estimate committee probe month state budget mr brief say police pay deal critical committee work chief commissioner share patron vehemently oppose introduction ninehour shift claim would add force annual wage bill also warn would force closure police station take police beat undermine community safety claim vehemently deny police union impression get question ask somehow sign deed determine outcome oblige party way negotiate mr caries say deed simply set parameter party agree dialogue discussion certainly not task sign deed direct confirm way enterprise agreement determined shadow police minister bad battle slam mr caries also minister race minister focused horse racing police course not explain mistake say anthony caries either totally incompetent intentionally misleading parliament either way fail pretend represent,"['anthony', 'caries', 'fire', 'admit', 'confuse', 'line', 'questioning', 'draw', 'criticism', 'either', 'totally', 'incompetent', 'intentionally', 'misleading', 'parliament', 'police', 'minister', 'anthony', 'caries', 'force', 'admit', 'mislead', 'parliament', 'amid', 'worsen', 'police', 'pay', 'crisis', 'threaten', 'become', 'big', 'schism', 'between', 'force', 'state', 'decade', 'victoria', 'police', 'remain', 'lock', 'bitter', 'stalemate', 'police', 'association', 'push', 'introduce', 'ninehour', 'shift', 'frontline', 'officer', 'appear', 'parliamentary', 'inquiry', 'tuesday', 'mr', 'caries', 'emphatically', 'deny', 'signature', 'deed', 'state', 'government', 'victoria', 'police', 'police', 'association', 'victoria', 'agree', 'implement', 'new', 'fostering', 'model', 'would', 'also', 'see', 'officer', 'work', 'nineday', 'fortnight', 'provide', 'not', 'incur', 'additional', 'cost', 'require', 'extra', 'resource', 'not', 'think', 'find', 'signature', 'piece', 'paper', 'relate', 'party', 'victoria', 'police', 'police', 'association', 'party', 'deed', 'agreement', 'commit', 'work', 'matter', 'assistance', 'leadership', 'mediator', 'mr', 'caries', 'say', 'process', 'continue', 'process', 'way', 'not', 'appropriate', 'government', 'minister', 'intervene', 'interfere', 'state', 'government', 'later', 'confirm', 'mr', 'caries', 'indeed', 'sign', 'deed', 'december', 'last', 'year', 'day', 'police', 'association', 'announced', 'breakthrough', 'mr', 'caries', 'later', 'admit', 'confuse', 'line', 'question', 'national', 'dandy', 'brief', 'veteran', 'public', 'account', 'estimate', 'committee', 'probe', 'month', 'state', 'budget', 'mr', 'brief', 'say', 'police', 'pay', 'deal', 'critical', 'committee', 'work', 'chief', 'commissioner', 'share', 'patron', 'vehemently', 'oppose', 'introduction', 'ninehour', 'shift', 'claim', 'would', 'add', 'force', 'annual', 'wage', 'bill', 'also', 'warn', 'would', 'force', 'closure', 'police', 'station', 'take', 'police', 'beat', 'undermine', 'community', 'safety', 'claim', 'vehemently', 'deny', 'police', 'union', 'impression', 'get', 'question', 'ask', 'somehow', 'sign', 'deed', 'determine', 'outcome', 'oblige', 'party', 'way', 'negotiate', 'mr', 'caries', 'say', 'deed', 'simply', 'set', 'parameter', 'party', 'agree', 'dialogue', 'discussion', 'certainly', 'not', 'task', 'sign', 'deed', 'direct', 'confirm', 'way', 'enterprise', 'agreement', 'determined', 'shadow', 'police', 'minister', 'bad', 'battle', 'slam', 'mr', 'caries', 'also', 'minister', 'race', 'minister', 'focused', 'horse', 'racing', 'police', 'course', 'not', 'explain', 'mistake', 'say', 'anthony', 'caries', 'either', 'totally', 'incompetent', 'intentionally', 'misleading', 'parliament', 'either', 'way', 'fail', 'pretend', 'represent']"

1d59r41,"I drink espresso so don’t really have the issue with milk, but curious as to why Soy or Almond milk incurs a higher charge? For the most part Soy milk is non-perishable stock and could be purchased in higher quantities (perhaps at a discount) and stored because it has a longer shelf-life. 

I just did a quick scan and The Alternative Dairy Co. Barista Soy Milk which claims it is “Uniquely blended by coffee freaks and lab coat geeks for unparalleled taste and performance” and has “consistent texturing and canvassing for perfect latte art” costs $37.44 for 12 x 1 Litre cartons, so $3.12 per litre. 

A litre of full cream Dairy Farmers milk costs around $3.90 and could only be stored for a short period and may at some point need to be thrown away. Doesn’t it make sense to then encourage people to choose Soy or Almond by milk by offering it at a lower price because in the long run the cafe saves money and isn’t throwing away stock. 

Perhaps I’m over simplifying it, but it seems obvious that if an inner-city cafe became known for selling soy, almond or oat milk lattes for $1-2 less than dairy milk lattes, it would attract more customers who want that kind of thing. I don’t know what the balance of plant based versus dairy milk latte orders would be on any given day, perhaps the vast majority still seek dairy and non-dairy drinkers are still a minority but given the theme of these threads, it sounds like people would be willing to trek a few more blocks or even switch from dairy to plant based if they felt it was a reasonable deal and not too far beyond what a cup of coffee should cost. 

I will add a couple of caveats before angry cafe owners tell me I don’t know what I’m talking about a) I DO NOT know what I am talking about and b) I have a machine at home, I load in the beans that I like, I push a button, it grinds them and espresso comes out, that’s as complicated as my coffee existence gets, so I’m definitely not a customer of yours and I don’t really care what the cost of a coffee is. I’m simply asking why Soy milk lattes incur an additional fee when it make sense to actually make them cheaper than dairy based lattes?

On Wednesday morning, Labor and the Coalition teamed up to oppose a Greens motion in the House of Representatives recognising the state of Palestine, with Mr Leeser telling The Australian after the vote that Labor needed to take key steps to distance itself from the minor party.

“It’s time Labor stopped preferencing the Greens on their ballot paper,” he said.

Mr Leeser expressed grave concern at the prospect of a hung parliament at the next election and the emergence of a Labor/Greens coalition.

“It is bad enough that Labor foreign policy is made on the floor of their national conference where they sell out one ally – Israel – to placate the Corbynites from attacking AUKUS,” Mr Leeser told The Australian. “But how much worse would it be if Labor allowed the Greens to dictate our foreign policy as the price of government?” “This is not an environmental party,” he said. “This is party that is obsessed with Israel and Jews.”

‘What is Adam Bandt advocating for?’: Labor MP questions Greens leader’s announcement

Only five people supported the Greens motion, including the four lower house Greens MPs and Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie, while 80 MPs voted against it.

Speaking in support of his own motion in the House of Representatives, Mr Bandt said that recognition of Palestine was long overdue and was not “just a symbolic move.”

“It is a critical step towards peace and towards ending the slaughter we are seeing with the invasion of Gaza,” he said. “It is a concrete step towards peace.”

“As the Prime Minister of Norway said last week, there cannot be peace in the Middle East if there is no recognition.” Mr Bandt said the “scale of the slaughter and the genocide that we are witnessing is now topping 36,000 people.”

“A health system has been destroyed. There are mass graves in hospitals. Aid has been blocked. Children are now dying because they do not have enough to eat or drink.”

He warned that a “human engineered famine” was now taking its toll on the civilian population in Gaza that “amounts to collective punishment of these people.”

Mr Bandt said that Labor’s credibility was also on the line, declaring that a two state solution could not be realised if you “recognise just one side.”

“Labor backs to the hilt a genocidal war that is destroying the possibility of a state of Palestine,” he said. “Labor has stood with the extreme Israeli government of Benjamin Netanyahu.” Josh Frydenberg slams the Greens for promoting ‘un-Australian values’

Assistant Foreign Minister Tim Watts took aim at Mr Bandt for the motion, arguing it was a stunt and an exercise in politics that would divide the community.

“Why he would be deliberately setting up a vote on Palestinian recognition to fail is something that only he can answer,” Mr Watts said..

“Simplistic wedge motions in the House do nothing to advance the cause of peace,” he said.

“Wedge politics only divides the community,” he said. “Anyone who is serious about peace knows that that requires a two state solution … but the Greens aren’t serious. They prefer slogans to policy. A two state solution requires working together and the recognition of each other.”

“On the question of recognition, we have made clear that we will be guided by whether recognition will advance the cause for peace. Like many countries Australia has been frustrated by the lack of progress in this regard,” he said. “Australia no longer sees recognition as only occurring at the end of the process. It could occur as part of a peace process.”

But Mr Watts said there would need to be serious governance reforms, noting that Hamas was a terrorist organisation. “We see no role for them in this,” he said. “A Palestinian state cannot be in the position to threaten Israel’s security.”

“We want to see a reformed Palestinian governing authority … We want to see a commitment to peace and how the Palestinian authority leads its people.”

Mr Leeser, who spoke against the motion, told the parliament that recognition should only occur after a peace agreement with Israel had been reached and negotiations on the ground had concluded. ‘End the occupation’: Greens Leader calls for Labor to 'take action' against Israel

“This motion … sends the message that Hamas’ violent terrorist attacks, its murders, its abductions, its gang rapes, and its dismemberment of innocent children and its torture of people should somehow be defendable,” he said. “This motion means recognising a Palestinian State when Hamas refuses to release more than 130 Israeli hostages.”

He also took aim at the Greens, saying that it was a party that promoted women’s rights and those of the LGBTI community but which was also advancing the “cause of organisations like Hamas which are among the greatest abusers of women (and) LGBTI people in the world.”

Mr Leeser, who describes himself as a proud and public Jewish MP, also said that anti-Semitism had “become a central plank of Green philosophy.”

“The Greens voted against the bipartisan motion that condemned the 7 October terrorist attacks that passed this House on 16 October – even before Israel had begun its operations in Gaza,” he said. “They refused to condemn Greens MP Jenny Leong for her comments that said Jews have tentacles and that Jews should not be able to participate in the public life of this country.”

Mr Leeser also noted that Mr Bandt, when directly asked on the ABC’s Insiders program about whether he supported the idea of a Jewish homeland state, would not answer.

Reflecting on the Greens motion, Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-chief executive Alex Ryvchin said the minor party had exposed “how hateful their ideology is and why the major parties should both pledge to preference this despicable party last.”",0,liberal julian lesser express alarm hung parliament next election could see green make unilateral recognition palestinian state weakening

However I feel like progressives labelling the whole country racists is having diminishing returns. Of course some people in Australia are racist and this may be worse in certain demographics. But for those that aren't who aren't also progressive, it is just alienating

Labelling everyone as racist will often mean you are blind to the true forces underlying racism or what appears to be racism, which IMO is usually economic inequality. People in economic hardship are more easily convinced their circumstances are the result of the other tribe and race can so easily play into that (eg if you are poor, why does it make sense to vote Yes in the referendum if you perceive that someone else gets a leg up when you are doing it tough)

In this sense, this type of rhetoric is divisive to the working class who need to be in solidarity to overcome those real economic problems. You can't let either side of politics tell you ordinary people are the problem.

**Members**: 50,000

**Status**: Ongoing

Victorian TAFE teachers began [industrial action ]( last month after the state government failed to put a “fair and reasonable pay and conditions offer” on the table.

On Friday, members voted to further escalate their fight by taking stop work actions in June and July, before escalating to a 24-hour work ban on August 21. They also won’t attend meetings.

Australian Education Union Victorian president Meredith Peace said for too long the concerns of TAFE teachers have been “neglected” by the government and TAFEs.

“TAFE teachers are burning out due to excessive and unsustainable workloads … This is unacceptable, particularly as Victoria deals with ongoing skills shortages, that require urgent intervention from the state government,” she said.

Other actions to be taken by members include stopping work for the duration of any campus visit by a state Labor MP, bans on performance of Excess Teaching Duty Hours and work related to auditing and professional development and recording student engagement or attendance.

Staff are also refusing to respond to management inquiries other than inquiries related to OHS matters, teacher’s entitlements, or student welfare.

$930 a week.

Far more affordable. 
They would be receiving $907 a week nett. 

Someone receiving $30 per hour would be on $1154 per week nett, hundreds more. But only $15 a week nett to the government in cost. 

People can then work 5 hours or 50 , we don’t spend billions of dollars on pedantic nonsense about people asset’s and everything little things they earn. 

You cut off hundreds of thousands of pages of red tape. 

Government departments should be running as they are all part of the same organisation, but they don’t. 
They have no idea how to cooperate with each other and work together towards a common cause.

1d5q1gh,"Just gonna do the major cities in alphabetical order here:

Adelaide - has suburban beaches all along its western side (other than some small areas with cliffs and others with mangrove forest), but lies in a sheltered gulf so the surf is minor at those beaches (which is mostly a good thing for swimming, obviously). Surf beaches are about an hour or two to the south. The climate is Mediterranean (hot, dry summers, mild/cool wet winters) and the ocean temperature is a little colder. So access is good for most of the year but a bit limited in winter, unless you are a hardcore. ""5 minutes from a beach"" is very attainable in a significant proportion of metropolitan Adelaide and most beaches are very uncrowded and peaceful. It's also decent for scuba in some parts of the state where there are seagrasses and cuttlefish.

Brisbane - slightly limited access to beaches in Brisbane itself - there are much better beaches slightly further afield in the Gold Coast or Sunshine Coast, which are separate cities. Brisbane itself has a kind of ""city beach"" thing on the Brisbane riverfront area, but it's not really much of a place to swim. The climate is subtropical - generally very warm and agreeable.

Canberra - inland city in the ""mountains"", with no ocean coastline and no beaches. Climate is generally quite cool. Very poor option for a beach lover, but a lovely city otherwise.

Darwin - has beaches, but you really can't swim at most of them because of the jellyfish and saltwater crocodiles (this applies generally in the tropical north). There is a sheltered ""waterfront"" area you can swim in that's very popular with locals and tourists alike. They also have a wavepool there. The climate is tropical - easily hot enough to entice you to swim all year long. But yeah, your options will be limited and in general you'd be better off with access to a pool.

Hobart - has some beaches I assume, but it is considerably cooler than the mainland cities and so you will probably need to be selective with when you go. Beachgoing is generally not seen as a theme of Hobart life.

Melbourne - has beaches, but like Adelaide it is on a sheltered bay/gulf so the surf is poor. You can venture further afield to towns along the southern coast for much better surfing beaches. The climate is marine coastal - some very warm and sunny days in summer, but more erratic weather in other months. It's probably more than fair to say that Melbourne is not as famous for its beach lifestyle as Sydney is. Although St Kilda and Brighton Beach are quite popular.

Perth - like Adelaide, has suburban beaches all along its western side, and like Adelaide, has a Mediterranean climate. Unlike Adelaide many of its suburban beaches are on the open Indian ocean and therefore have a stronger surf. They also are a bit narrower and rockier than Adelaide beaches I think. Some may argue, but realistically I think Perth is probably the best answer for your question as far as larger cities go - weather, surf, ease of access. Although Adelaide is very comparable/close (moreso than a lot of people think).

Sydney - has very highly rated beaches on its Eastern side towards the Pacific Ocean...but so highly rated that they are invariably very crowded, which can be a hassle for actually going to them in several ways (parking/access, crowds, etc). The surf can be quite strong unless you go to a more sheltered beach. Most people in Sydney live a long way out to the west due to very unaffordable housing elsewhere, so ""being 5 minutes from a beach"" is much less attainable than it might seem. The weather is subtropical like Brisbane, but Sydney tends to be a bit prone to strong storm fronts which can present challenges for beachgoers. You will need to be very aware of things like rip tides and the importance of swimming between the flags. That said, it's hard to deny that Sydney is famous for its beaches and is internationally recognised for that fact - that's not without reason. They are stunning, and it almost goes without saying that beachgoing is a huge part of the culture/lifestyle in Sydney.

So those are the capitals/major cities. Adelaide, Perth and Sydney would be my top recs to seriously think about. You can find plenty of pics and vids online to get a feel for what the beaches look like in these places. Here are some samples which I think give you a good enough overview of what to expect in each city, but there are lots and lots of these sorts of videos floating around:

[Perth (tour of general suburban coastline)](

[Sydney (tour of several most popular beaches)](

[Adelaide (Henley Beach)]( [Adelaide (Brighton Beach)]( [Adelaide (Grange Beach)]( [Adelaide (Glenelg Beach)]( [Adelaide (Glenelg Beach)](  [Adelaide (Semaphore Beach)]( [Adelaide (Aldinga Beach)]( [Adelaide (Christie's Beach)]( [Adelaide (Sellick's Beach)]( [Adelaide (Maslin Beach)]( - (I couldn't find a good general tour video, but as you can see there are a lot of beaches and quite a bit of variety)

[Melbourne (St Kilda, Brighton)](

[Gold Coast (Surfer's Paradise)]( - arguably one of the nation's best (or best known) beaches, but a lot more than 5 minutes away from Brisbane. Gold Coast is its own distinct city, but much smaller than Brisbane and very much a tourist hotspot. All those buildings you can see in the video are hotels and apartments.

[Darwin (Waterfront)]( - very limited area you can actually swim, but it is literally almost always 32°C

[Hobart (Nutgrove Beach)]( - realistically quite often too cold to swim AFAIK...but very beautiful.

However, you might want to consider some smaller/regional coastal cities as places where you are more likely to be able to get accommodation within 5 minutes of the beach. I will list a few towns that are well known for their beachgoing lifestyles by state:

NSW - Byron Bay, Coffs Harbour, Wollongong, Newcastle

QLD - Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Mackay, Airlie Beach, Bundaberg, Yeppoon

SA - Ceduna, Port Lincoln, Moonta/Wallaroo, Port Elliot/Victor Harbor, Robe, Emu Bay 

TAS - Bicheno, Coles Bay

VIC - Apollo Bay, Torquay, Lorne, Warrnambool, Sorrento, Bell's Beach, Geelong, Sale

WA - Margaret River, Bunbury, Albany, Broome, Esperance, Shark Bay

There are many others. These are mostly quite small places - accommodation will possibly be cheaper, but work will likely be much harder to find.",0,donna major city alphabetical order adelaide suburban reach along western

1d5ngze,"The debt-burdened Allan government is spruiking its wholly public births, deaths and marriages agency to private investors in a bid to bolster its beleaguered finances.

Treasurer Tim Pallas has begun discussions with private equity firms to gauge their interest in running some of the registry’s services.

Pallas met with one firm last week, according to a private industry source familiar with the negotiations, and pitched the idea as a “limited-term contract” in the style of the partial privatisation of VicRoads’ licensing and registration arms – a deal due to expire in the 2060s.

The industry source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardise commercial interests, said the treasurer was “hoping to close any deal by the end of the year”.

A fresh offer from a private consortium could raise billions of dollars in the short term for Victoria’s bottom line while providing superannuation companies or others with tens of millions of dollars in guaranteed annual income from birth, death and marriage certificates.

A cabinet minister, also speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed there was a desire for several years at the highest levels of government to rebuild Births, Deaths and Marriages through the private market.

“It can probably be done better,” the minister said.

The senior MP went on to say the registry would ideally be brought back into the government fold entirely once it had proven its value to the taxpayer.

Births, Deaths and Marriages has dealt with high-profile issues in recent years, particularly during the pandemic, when its offices were closed, it took months for officials to issue certificates and urgent emails went unanswered.

Asked if the agency was to be privatised, a government spokesperson instead described the preferred model as a joint venture partnership.

“Victoria’s Births, Deaths and Marriages service will not be privatised, but we are looking at how we can continue to improve the quality of government services.”

The government to this day insists the partial privatisation of some VicRoads services was not privatisation, but a joint venture partnership.

Just seven months ago, the government was predicting it would be in deficit by about $1 billion by June 2025. That expected financial hole more than doubled to $2.2 billion in the May 7 state budget.

The same budget papers forecast Victoria’s debt to rise to $187.8 billion by June 2028. In simple terms, the May budget leaves Victorian taxpayers with a $25 million daily interest bill.

Labor’s primary vote has also plummeted below 30 per cent since Jacinta Allan became premier, according to an exclusive survey published by this masthead last month. The survey found two-thirds of voters wanted the government to do more to reduce debt.

But additional partial privatisation in the name of budget repair would not come without risks. The Coalition will use any proposed agreement with industry to slam the government’s management of debt and government agencies. Meanwhile, the Greens would argue such a move undermines the public service.

Labor will also be in power in Victoria for a decade come December, the timeframe Pallas has told industry he wants the agency deal signed.

Researcher Charlie Joyce, from the independent but progressive think tank the Australia Institute, said he suspected further privatisation was politically dangerous in Victoria.

“Daniel Andrews campaigned in 2022 against privatisation,” Joyce said. “He promised to bring back the State Electricity Commission. A further re-embrace of privatisation would lead to a loss in trust in the Allan government which, I think, frankly, is already fraying.”

Joyce said while Victoria’s debt levels were an important consideration, his research on privatisation showed even partial privatisation was often “short-term gain for long-term pain”.

“For something like Births, Deaths and Marriages, this is a government service that handles very sensitive information. A private owner that cuts costs on security – cybersecurity in particular – could quite quickly run into trouble.

“It would [also] be a colossal mistake to take a step that may reduce the quality of public services and increase the cost.”

Birth, death, marriage or change of name certificates start from $54.40 in Victoria, but registrations and commemorative certificates are more expensive. There were 72,932 registered births in Victoria last year, 29,826 marriages and 45,345 deaths.

The total administered income from identity and worker screening transactions in Victoria for the six months to June 30 last year was $33.83 million, according to the Department of Government Services’ most recent publicly available annual report.

The same report states that Births, Deaths and Marriages failed to meet its timeliness target in the 2022-23 financial year.

It took the agency, on average, 10.9 days to process compliant applications for birth, death and marriage certificates in the 12 months to June last year. Its target for the period was less than 10 days.

The price of general-issue licence plates, black motorbike plates and slimline black custom licence plates all increased by $15 on January.

Driver licensing and registration aren’t the only services partly privatised since Victorian Labor came to power in December 2014.

The Port of Melbourne was leased to a private consortium for 50 years under a $9.7 billion deal in 2016 and the Victorian Land Titles Office was partly privatised in 2018 for more than $2 billion.

Last year’s housing statement also revealed Melbourne’s public high-rise towers will be handed over to private developers in the coming years as part of a mixed model.

When VicRoads was partly privatised in 2022, Pallas refused to label the development privatisation.

“This is not privatisation in anybody’s language,” the treasurer said at the time.

“We’re always looking to see how we can drive better services, better performance, but we will never divest the ownership of assets.”

The partial privatisation of VicRoads was also pitched as injecting $7.9 billion into Victoria’s coffers.

Under the VicRoads deal, the state maintains ownership of the service, the Victorian Ombudsman preserves its oversight and there were extensive talks with the Australian Services Union to ensure workers kept their jobs.

However, a consortium comprising Aware Super, Australian Retirement Trust and Macquarie Asset Management was allowed to run the agency’s licensing and registration for the next 40 years.",0,debtburdened allay government strike wholly public birth death marriage agency private investor bid bolster beleaguered finance treasurer tim dallas begin discussion private equity firm

The Albanese government has yet to prove it has the substance to stand up to the Greens. Its record to date is one of being too eager to cut a deal or shy away from a fight. Good policy – most recently legislation to give certainty to the offshore gas industry and discourage unjustified lawfare attacks by protest groups – has been put on ice to appease the Greens. Changes to the nation’s environmental laws have been delayed because it is too difficult to find a sensible way to allow development and protect the natural world, something business supports.

Labor already has said it will delay introducing legislation for its $13.7bn package of production credits for hydrogen producers and critical minerals processing announced in the federal budget to allow time to negotiate with the Greens. Whatever one may think about the Albanese government’s corporate subsidy agenda, the Greens will only make it worse.

The Greens have pledged to use their balance-of-power position to frustrate the government’s wider agenda. This includes housing, where by focusing on renters the Greens have outflanked the federal government electorally in its inner-city seats. Voters must heed the lessons of the minor parties. For all the high ideals expressed before the last election, the teals have failed to make an impression. The Greens, once again, have shown by their actions they will only make our politics and economy poorer for their interventions.",1,niceinterest protest party green care little impact handling position would ordinary australian undergraduate destructive stance take g rein leader adam band october terrorist attack israel proof enough harm farleft party pose australia community adhesion inflammatory detour foreign policy calculate embarrass anthony albanese outrageous antiisrael stand part big threat green represent national identity good government allow get close lever power de facto coalition millard labor government balanceofpower position federal senate today green expose wrecker albanese government yet prove substance stand green record date one eager cut deal shy away fight good policy recently legislation give certainty offshore gas industry discourage justify aware attack protest group put ice appease green change nation environmental law delay difficult find sensible way allow development protect natural world something business support labor already say delay introducing legislation in package production credit hydrogen producer critical mineral process announce federal budget allow time negotiate green whatever one may think albanese government corporate subsidy agenda green make bad green pledge use balanceofpower position frustrate government wide agenda include housing rouse renter green outflank federal government electoral innercity seat voter must heed lesson minor party high ideal express last election tear fail make impression green show action make politics economy poorer intervention,"['niceinterest', 'protest', 'party', 'green', 'care', 'little', 'impact', 'handling', 'position', 'would', 'ordinary', 'australian', 'undergraduate', 'destructive', 'stance', 'take', 'g', 'rein', 'leader', 'adam', 'band', 'october', 'terrorist', 'attack', 'israel', 'proof', 'enough', 'harm', 'farleft', 'party', 'pose', 'australia', 'community', 'adhesion', 'inflammatory', 'detour', 'foreign', 'policy', 'calculate', 'embarrass', 'anthony', 'albanese', 'outrageous', 'antiisrael', 'stand', 'part', 'big', 'threat', 'green', 'represent', 'national', 'identity', 'good', 'government', 'allow', 'get', 'close', 'lever', 'power', 'de', 'facto', 'coalition', 'millard', 'labor', 'government', 'balanceofpower', 'position', 'federal', 'senate', 'today', 'green', 'expose', 'wrecker', 'albanese', 'government', 'yet', 'prove', 'substance', 'stand', 'green', 'record', 'date', 'one', 'eager', 'cut', 'deal', 'shy', 'away', 'fight', 'good', 'policy', 'recently', 'legislation', 'give', 'certainty', 'offshore', 'gas', 'industry', 'discourage', 'justify', 'aware', 'attack', 'protest', 'group', 'put', 'ice', 'appease', 'green', 'change', 'nation', 'environmental', 'law', 'delay', 'difficult', 'find', 'sensible', 'way', 'allow', 'development', 'protect', 'natural', 'world', 'something', 'business', 'support', 'labor', 'already', 'say', 'delay', 'introducing', 'legislation', 'in', 'package', 'production', 'credit', 'hydrogen', 'producer', 'critical', 'mineral', 'process', 'announce', 'federal', 'budget', 'allow', 'time', 'negotiate', 'green', 'whatever', 'one', 'may', 'think', 'albanese', 'government', 'corporate', 'subsidy', 'agenda', 'green', 'make', 'bad', 'green', 'pledge', 'use', 'balanceofpower', 'position', 'frustrate', 'government', 'wide', 'agenda', 'include', 'housing', 'rouse', 'renter', 'green', 'outflank', 'federal', 'government', 'electoral', 'innercity', 'seat', 'voter', 'must', 'heed', 'lesson', 'minor', 'party', 'high', 'ideal', 'express', 'last', 'election', 'tear', 'fail', 'make', 'impression', 'green', 'show', 'action', 'make', 'politics', 'economy', 'poorer', 'intervention']"

1d0p5nx,"He claimed that by “rebalancing the migration program … the Coalition would free up almost 40,000 additional homes in the first year. And well over 100,000 homes in the next five years.”

How this number was calculated, he didn’t say. It appeared all the more dubious given his Fordham interview suggested Dutton did not know which migration numbers applied to which year, and given the big discrepancy between him and his treasury spokesman over the size of the cuts.

There is, in any case, reason to question the extent to which migration numbers affect the cost of buying or renting a home. During the Covid lockdowns, when Australia’s borders were closed and net migrant numbers fell to zero, prices continued to rise rapidly.

According to modelling from the Grattan Institute, high migration does have some effect on housing costs. For every 100,000 above the long-term average, rents rise about 1 per cent. Thus last year, by this estimate, Australia’s record number of migrants probably pushed them up about 3 per cent.

But, says Trent Wiltshire, Grattan’s deputy director of migration and labour markets, “asking rents have been rising 10 per cent a year. So it’s a factor, but certainly not the driving factor.”

Migrants bring economic benefits as well as costs. Based on the rather sketchy information provided by Dutton, says Wiltshire, “it looks like there would be a decline in skilled migration of around 135,000 over the next four years, compared to the existing skilled migration intake.

“Such a reduction would mean the lifetime fiscal cost from these skilled migrants not being here would be $34 billion.”

With all due respect to Grattan, it is very hard to assess precisely what the economic consequences of Dutton’s proposed cuts would be, because so little detail has been provided about exactly where they would fall.

What is clear is that for more than a year, Dutton and other members of the Coalition have been fanning public concerns about the number of migrants coming to Australia, and blaming the Labor government for the influx.

This is simply not true, policy experts say. In fact, the explosion in NOM was substantially a consequence of decisions made by the previous Coalition government in response to the pandemic.

In the 2019 budget, the last before the pandemic, NOM was forecast to be about 270,000, a little above the long-term average. Instead, because of Covid, it plunged close to zero for two years.

When the borders reopened, the Morrison government made a series of panicked decisions aimed at encouraging workers, and particularly overseas students, to return.

“In 2021-22 the Coalition government introduced extraordinary policies to boost … numbers,” says Abul Rizvi, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration. “Policies such as unlimited work rights for students, fee-free student and working holiday-maker applications and a special Covid visa.

“The message to industry was to go forth and expand as rapidly as possible and hang the consequences. So it did. Not only did universities go berserk recruiting as many students as they could, but private providers also boomed as the regulators were in no position to police quality. It was like an unregulated gold rush,” says Rizvi.

The changes amounted to an attempt to undo the damage caused by the Coalition government’s shabby treatment of overseas students when Covid hit, says Phil Honeywood, chief executive of the International Education Association of Australia.

In contrast with countries such as Britain and Canada, which provided support for overseas students to stay, “Scott Morrison told students to just go home,” says Honeywood.

1d276je,">how seriously would you take the threat

That's a tough one. It's incredibly difficult to judge how strong someone is, mentally. And I'm not a psychiatrist, so there's no fucking way I'm going to trust my own judgement.

My advice is that — don't rely on your own judgement. Because this is too important to get wrong.

It's also hard to know if you should have a word with his superiors or not — your colleague would have done that themselves if they wanted to.

Having said that, as someone who is a manager, I would absolutely want to know that one of my employees is working too much. I don't really know how hard someone is working unless I'm closely supervising them... and frankly I don't have time to do that. I've got too many people under me. I rely on people telling me if they need to be given a lighter workload.

But within the coalition of the LGBTQIA+ I just want to hone in on the plus. That includes a group of people who identify as minor attracted persons. I would encourage all citizens and councillors to look up what being a minor attracted persons means.” Dr Brough said.*

Dr Bough then doubled down on this position in a later interview.

This was a comment made apparently in reference to the Pride Festival held in Albany and some negative community feedback received in respect of it. Once again, I don't see this as an Agenda item in the February meeting.

1d4yqmo,"One of Australia’s most frustrating failures as a nation has been a limited capacity to value-add. This country has the world’s third-largest population of sheep – behind China and India – but much of the Australian wool-clothing we wear is imported, such as men's suits from Italy. There are a multitude of similar examples. Why is it so difficult to add value here, to become an exporter of finished products as well as raw materials? The excuses typically offered are that our labour costs are too high, we don’t have the necessary skills, our design and managerial systems’ capacities are limited or deficient, among a host of others. While there may be some elements of substance to these arguments, it is probably more relevant to blame a failure to create a deliverable national strategy for industrial development.

The Coalition’s usual response has been that such development should be left to the market; however, the government has a responsibility to set the framework for where those market forces should be encouraged to operate to their best advantage. The Albanese government’s Future Made in Australia (FMIA) strategy should be seen as an attempt to meet that responsibility. One important feature of the latest budget was that it provided some of the detail and commitments of such a national strategy, recognising that this country’s transition to a cheaper, clean energy future, and possibly into a global energy superpower, is the most significant industrial shift to come.

A key element of the FMIA package so far is the National Battery Strategy launched last week. Of course, the visionless, destructive and denialist opposition remains content to argue that the focus on renewables leaves this country without a capacity to ensure baseload power. They claim renewables don’t work when the sun doesn't shine and the wind doesn't blow – ignoring the potential for cost-effective energy storage from these sources. As Minister for Climate Change and Energy Chris Bowen points out, this country learnt how to store water when it doesn’t rain all the time, so why not sun and wind power?

The battery strategy sets out a “vision” over the next decade, in which Australia becomes “a globally competitive producer of batteries and battery materials, providing secure and resilient battery supply chains, delivering affordable and secure energy for Australians, boosting productivity, and creating wealth and opportunity while being part of the global energy transition”.

We certainly have the minerals in abundance, in a strong resources sector, as well as manufacturers’ know-how, sufficient trading partners and skills capacity in our workforce. The government has now provided the necessary framework and identifies certain financial commitments. We just need to get on with it!

The global battery industry is dominated by China, whose market share is estimated to be as high as 75 per cent, although there are other significant players such as Japan’s Panasonic and others that may be ripe for joint ventures. I recall an early statement by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, who said he didn't want his electric vehicle company Tesla to be dependent on the Chinese for batteries. Is there potential here to become a battery supplier to Tesla? The scope for a battery industry in Australia is enormous. A particular focus domestically is achieving grid-scale and community storage, beyond the expansion of mining critical minerals. I have been struck that the usual list of these minerals often excludes graphite, as Australia is one of the few politically stable countries with significant reserves of natural graphite, which would seem to be an advantage, as natural graphite has superior heat-storing capacity. Most of the graphite used globally is synthetic, and mostly manufactured by the Chinese, using a dirty and energy-intensive heating process to convert petroleum coke, a residue of the oil refining industry, to synthetic graphite. I am also aware of an Australian-patented technology that uses a self-contained chemical process, with no wastage, to refine natural graphite, removing “impurities” such as iron and silica, and further improving the storage capabilities. Miners can also market these byproducts, providing additional income streams to the straight sale of the graphite.

Our graphite industry has enormous untapped potential, which should be released by the government’s battery strategy. An important related point is the potential of graphite-based thermal storage has been largely ignored in Australia, as the process of concentrated solar thermal became too expensive and, in part, because of the fad-like attraction of pumped hydro. This technology has also turned out to be more difficult and expensive than anticipated – note the cost blowouts and tunnelling difficulties of Snowy 2.0, the mother of all pumped hydro projects, which, as I pointed out in an earlier column, didn’t stack up on a rigorous cost-benefit analysis.

The potential advantages of graphite-based thermal storage for grid-scale and community batteries ought to be more widely recognised. Consider the possibility of a new housing development with a community battery, fed by each of the houses having solar roofs rather than just solar panels. This would enable each house to draw electricity, and hot water and hot air for heating and cooling, even for cooking, as required. These homes might never again receive a power bill.

Thermal storage also opens the possibility of generating steam at the desired temperatures, which would be significant for industries such as processed food, cement, and even steel making.

There is an important distinction in grid-scale storage systems between electric batteries and what is known as load-shifting batteries. The Hornsdale Power Reserve battery that Musk built in South Australia is an electric battery that really only provides short-term back-up to variations in power supply, whereas a load-shifting battery stores the sun or wind energy when the sun is shining and the wind is blowing to be drawn down in evening and morning peaks, for example, guaranteeing dispatchable or base-load electricity.

The recent budget committed a significant amount of new money to fund the government’s battery strategy. Specifically, $523.2 million for a “battery breakthrough” initiative to help manufacturers build capacity in crucial areas with a focus on “high-value battery products” that align with our areas of advantage and support the climate energy transition. There was a further $20.3 million for building future battery capabilities to develop skills and expertise, $5.6 million to deliver an “Australian-made battery precinct” in partnership with the Queensland government and $1.7 billion for a Future Made in Australia innovation fund that will support innovation, commercialisation, pilot and demonstration projects and early-stage developments in priority sectors, including development in battery technologies.

The implementation of this battery strategy will need careful coordination, both domestically and internationally. In Australia, state and local governments must collaborate, along with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and private financiers. These efforts may also need community action plans, including for First Nations communities in areas where there is potential for expanded mining developments. Internationally, it will be important to work and trade with both the United States and China. Efforts must be made to avoid being swept along with the US’s anti-China strategy and possibly to demonstrate a willingness to work with China, where there are advantages in terms of both technology and money.

Of course, an important issue that will inevitably arise is the need for effective taxation of those who gain approvals to mine the critical minerals. The overarching need is to recognise these are national resources, the mining of which should be to the benefit of all Australians. As easy as this is to say, the past attempts at introducing a mining tax under the Rudd–Gillard governments demonstrated just how easily this basic requirement can get lost in the melee of dealing with the mining industry.

Whatever happens, this engagement with the private sector needs to be dealt with effectively moving forward. In summary, the government’s battery strategy is both a visionary and a realistic response to the challenge of taking up a leading role in the inevitable global energy transition.",0,one australia

Politicians may not really care about their donors paying less taxes, but their bosses do. I hope judges are mostly honest as they have usually decided to make less money than they would as lawyers. However, this one has shown too many signs of corruption. The people who appoint and promote judges are corrupt and McBride had secrets they wouldn't let the public know.

Also, the judge hid that sentencing was going to take place until a last minute change of plans. I believe that being more senior, more visible and less incentivised to appease politicians should mean judges of the high court are trustworthy (certainly a hundred times more trustworthy than Mossop).

1d4uh64,"Bit off topic, but it will be really interesting to see the proposed boundaries for NSW;  the eastern half of metro Sydney is set to lose one or maybe two seats, and I'm curious as to which side of the harbour this will take place. 

I don't think it's feasible for a cross-harbour seat to be created, so I think North Sydney (especially as it's one of the federation seats) and Sydney aren't going anywhere.

I think if one of the northern seats will disappear, the one which makes most geographical sense will be Warringah. Mackellar can't move north of the Hawkesbury as it will be non-contiguous, so I think it will become a thinner, beach-oriented seat. Bradfield, Bennelong, and North Sydney could be pushed east; the latter could feasibly cross Middle Harbour in a similar manner as the state seat of Manly.

Then again, the AEC wants to retain Aboriginal place names when possible, which complicates things yet again. 

As a side note, I dislike the practice of non-geographical names for electoral divisions (even though in this case, Warringah is a geographical name). I'm no advocate for the American numerical system, and I do recognise that geographical names can sometimes [be]( [unneccesarily]( [specific]( however using the geographical centre of the seat (as the NSWEC does) leads to fewer absurdities; Lake George, for instance, existed within the seat of Werriwa for only a decade, and Warringah possibly moving north to replace Mackellar while no longer covering Middle Harbour just creates another pointless quirk.

If it's on the south side of the harbour, then I think it will be messier. Wentworth is another 1901 seat, so I could see its boundaries moving south. Alternatively, Sydney could theoretically be split between Wentworth and Grayndler (it is oddly enough the newest of the three), but I don't think that would please anyone. I can't imagine the AEC removing Albanese's seat either. Possibly Barton could be partitioned?

Also interested to see what will happen in the Hunter. Labor seems intent on shoring up Hunter at the expense of Paterson (demographics trending away from the party in both) by drawing in Maitland and cutting out the Upper Hunter, but the geographical constraints of Port Stephens and Lake Macquarie could well lead to an arragement that would make an Illinois mapmaker blush.",0,bit topic really interesting see propose boundary eastern half retro sydney set lose one maybe two seat curious side harbour take place not think feasible crossharbour seat create think north sydney especially one federation seat sydney not go anywhere think one northern seat disappear one make geographical sense war mackellar not move north hawkesbury noncontiguous think become thinner beachtormented seat bradfield bennelong north sydney could push east latter could feasible cross middle harbour similar manner state seat manly aet want retain original place name possible complicate thing yet side note dislike practice nongeographical name electoral division even though case warring geographical name no advocate american numerical system recognise geographical name sometimes unnecessarily specific however use geographical centre seat answer lead fewer absurdity lake george instance exist within seat werriwa decade war possibly move north replace mackellar no longer cover middle harbour create another painless quick south side harbour think easy wentworth another seat could see boundary move south alternatively sydney could theoretical split wentworth grayndler oddly enough new three not think would please anyone not imagine aet remove albanese s seat either possibly barton could partition also interested see happen hunter labor seem intent show hunter expense paterson demographic tread away party draw mainland cut upper hunter geographical constraint port stephen lake macquarie could well lead arrangement would make illinois mapmaker blush,"['bit', 'topic', 'really', 'interesting', 'see', 'propose', 'boundary', 'eastern', 'half', 'retro', 'sydney', 'set', 'lose', 'one', 'maybe', 'two', 'seat', 'curious', 'side', 'harbour', 'take', 'place', 'not', 'think', 'feasible', 'crossharbour', 'seat', 'create', 'think', 'north', 'sydney', 'especially', 'one', 'federation', 'seat', 'sydney', 'not', 'go', 'anywhere', 'think', 'one', 'northern', 'seat', 'disappear', 'one', 'make', 'geographical', 'sense', 'war', 'mackellar', 'not', 'move', 'north', 'hawkesbury', 'noncontiguous', 'think', 'become', 'thinner', 'beachtormented', 'seat', 'bradfield', 'bennelong', 'north', 'sydney', 'could', 'push', 'east', 'latter', 'could', 'feasible', 'cross', 'middle', 'harbour', 'similar', 'manner', 'state', 'seat', 'manly', 'aet', 'want', 'retain', 'original', 'place', 'name', 'possible', 'complicate', 'thing', 'yet', 'side', 'note', 'dislike', 'practice', 'nongeographical', 'name', 'electoral', 'division', 'even', 'though', 'case', 'warring', 'geographical', 'name', 'no', 'advocate', 'american', 'numerical', 'system', 'recognise', 'geographical', 'name', 'sometimes', 'unnecessarily', 'specific', 'however', 'use', 'geographical', 'centre', 'seat', 'answer', 'lead', 'fewer', 'absurdity', 'lake', 'george', 'instance', 'exist', 'within', 'seat', 'werriwa', 'decade', 'war', 'possibly', 'move', 'north', 'replace', 'mackellar', 'no', 'longer', 'cover', 'middle', 'harbour', 'create', 'another', 'painless', 'quick', 'south', 'side', 'harbour', 'think', 'easy', 'wentworth', 'another', 'seat', 'could', 'see', 'boundary', 'move', 'south', 'alternatively', 'sydney', 'could', 'theoretical', 'split', 'wentworth', 'grayndler', 'oddly', 'enough', 'new', 'three', 'not', 'think', 'would', 'please', 'anyone', 'not', 'imagine', 'aet', 'remove', 'albanese', 's', 'seat', 'either', 'possibly', 'barton', 'could', 'partition', 'also', 'interested', 'see', 'happen', 'hunter', 'labor', 'seem', 'intent', 'show', 'hunter', 'expense', 'paterson', 'demographic', 'tread', 'away', 'party', 'draw', 'mainland', 'cut', 'upper', 'hunter', 'geographical', 'constraint', 'port', 'stephen', 'lake', 'macquarie', 'could', 'well', 'lead', 'arrangement', 'would', 'make', 'illinois', 'mapmaker', 'blush']"

This puts Labor in a position they're very comfortable in - lip service about the change they want, but only carrying out the changes they need (or believe they can afford) to make.

This is a fundamental issue with democracy under neoliberal and capitalist assumptions. It keeps the leftwing establishment from the proper work of nation building, keeps them ""tinkering around the edges"" as the article puts it - and allows for a ratcheting to the right of politics.

It's easy to cut taxes on wealth and big business donors. It's easy to take some money from here, put it there, to let Capitalism usurp your party's values over time. Much easier than standing up for your country, your values, or people who actually vote you in/out.

1cveo31,"“By July 2022 it was clear that MOWA did not have the required operational capability to engage directly with \[Meals on Wheels\] services, to implement Future Fit initiatives, nor manage operational software,” the Miles Morgan final report says. “NSW and QLD state associations agreed. Attempts were then made to work with the state associations directly, which enabled increased, direct contact with services.

“However, by 29 March 2023, South Australia, Tasmania and the NSW state association had opted out of Future Fit. Noting as at 8 September 2023 Tasmania has to \[sic\] re-joined following changes to their board and management team.”

By many accounts, MMA went to war with those who did not support the transformation initiative.

In a September 2023 submission to the parliamentary inquiry into the integrity of consulting services, Meals on Wheels Victoria state manager Alina Tooley said the mission to bring services together in a “unified” national network was being undercut by MMA.

“Rather than stabilising and modernising the network, MMA are creating more work for an already overworked sector, and causing confusion, disharmony and angst,” the submission says. “The national meals network is now less stable than prior to the commencement of Future Fit.”

In its own final report, MMA singled out Meals on Wheels Victoria for its “multi-year campaign … to prosecute the problem, raise community fears and failure to offer a solution”.

As local councils increasingly look to get out of running Meals on Wheels services themselves, enormous gaps have emerged in a crucial but poorly funded segment of the aged-care sector.

In March last year, Aged Care Minister Anika Wells announced a $2.2 million pilot program through Meals on Wheels Newcastle and the Queensland body to take over the services vacated by Whitehorse and Ballarat local councils in Victoria. The funding was made through Future Fit, she announced.

Meals on Wheels Victoria was not approached to run the service.

Correspondence between Gunaratnam and health department secretary Russell Herald, who is the departmental signatory on the MMA contracts, confirms the consulting firm was deeply involved in the Whitehorse transition from July last year, right down to the details of the menu cycle, although MMA is not an accredited provider of home support services.

“How are we going with PDF’s of the fortnightly menus?” Herald asked MMA in October. “Any chance by tomorrow.”

Herald, in his capacity as the contract owner and with aged-care policy responsibility for home support, has worked closely with MMA. In turn the consultancy has worked with an existing aged-care company, Polixen, which has long offered a desktop customer resource management (CRM) tool designed specifically for Meals on Wheels providers.

The vast majority of Meals on Wheels services in MMA’s own surveys said they used Polixen software to manage clients’ resources, delivery routes and rosters.

In the second official work order signed by Gunaratnam and Herald, MMA is required to “build a replacement CRM” for Meals on Wheels providers between 2021 and 2023.

To do this, MMA first subcontracted a Canberra firm named Agile Digital but relations broke down and MMA stopped paying for its services. Some work on the CRM had been done and MMA allegedly took this to a new company named GoSource. A contract between the two was developed in November last year. A CRM has still not been delivered.",0,july clear iowa not required operational capability engage directly meal wheels service implement future fit initiative nor manage operational software mile

In addition that highway carries a very large amount of heavy traffic, and loaded with supplies you're going to absolutely max out at 80kph and likely spend a lot of time under it.

You're going to be constantly overtaken by a mixture of very large trucks and grey nomads with caravans and you will have nowhere to go.  You will be stuck with no paved surface to ride on and either have to run onto the dirt, the surface of which is very inconsistent, or hope to hell you don't get smooshed as they overtake.

The only way I would consider this run on a CT is if I resigned myself to do 40kph the whole way on the dirt edge.

>In Question Time the Opposition asked across the Chamber, surely the Government isn't asking nothers to delay having their babies, while they're transferred to other hospitals due to maternity closures? 

>With Labor suggesting women could just bypass their local hospital to go to another hospital to give birth, I could not believe Labor was telling mothers to ""cross your legs"" while in labour.

>This is the comment I made. 

>We have had women give birth on the side of the road in Queensland due to maternity services being closed in regional areas and this is what we were demanding the Health Minister answer for today.

Firstly, if you are going to accuse me of wildly engaging in misinformation, it would be nice if you did me the courtesy of reading what I write until you comprehend it. 

Both the judge and I distinguished between the cases deemed most comparable and those that were simply mentioned. One of the cases that was merely mentioned was about a lawyer stealing $220 000 from a disabled client (which is a lot worse than blowing the whistle), another that was merely mentioned was about stealing work tools. You’ve skimmed the conclusion of the judgment and cherry picked the least relevant and in one case most evil cases you could find.

I can't take you seriously if you pretend it’s a coincidence the sentencing was held on budget day. That and the harshness of the sentence despite all the considerations I’ve listed are evidence of the judge’s bias.

The Nazis obeyed orders and Stanislav Petrov disobeyed them, those are my points.

As his new lawyer will argue in court, he had duties that prevailed to the extent of any other duty. He could not have held his position as a military lawyer without having this duty. The proceedings in the High Court will shed light on this and most likely result in McBride being exonerated or at least given a better sentence for a whistle blower.

It’s a lot easier to prove illegal procedures in investigating cases before you, than to prove cases of war crimes your superiors don’t want you to see. If you look at the extracts of McBride’s statements to police in the sentencing transcript, they will shed light on his motivations.

His previous lawyers took a very limited approach in defending David. Perhaps Mark Davis saw this case too much like a journalist (which he was) and that is why he didn't devote his time to making contingency plans in case his main argument was dismissed.

You are referencing the defense department investigating itself when McBride concerns were with the leadership of the defense department.

1d05ofu,"I would encourage everyone to read the AAT decisions in question before they leap to any conclusions. In [the XRGY decision]( for example, the human-trafficking allegations were given serious consideration. But the allegation came from ASIO and the AFP declined to prosecute him for the crime. From 53:

>In the absence of a criminal conviction the decision-maker should rarely find that the conduct which would constitute an offence has occurred . . . The task of ASIO is a different task to that of adducing criminal guilt. It is the AFP that is best placed to investigate, charge and refer to the Director of Public Prosecutions cases of people smuggling. In the Applicant’s case, it has not done so. . . . If the Tribunal were to prefer or put more weight on the ASIO material than the AFP material, such an approach would raise Constitutional separation of power issues.

Given the above, it wasn't really possible for the AAT to treat the allegations any other way. This is trial by media, essentially.

I haven't looked for the Saki decision, but the minister's comments may well be accurate: that the AAT didn't properly consider the likelihood of reoffending. Easy to say in retrospect, of course, but even so, it's not evidence that the direction is a problem, just its application.

I know Dutton (and possibly others here) think we should be able to apply extra-judicial punishment to non-citizens. Serve your time and then piss off home. Untested allegation? Too bad, get out. But not only is this a textbook authoritarian approach, and not only does it compromise our international obligations including those against non-refoulement ([discussion here]( there's also the fact that the international community could start doing it to us.

 Miners have poured a record $74bn into the coffers of federal, state and territory governments, with the Albanese government pocketing $42.5bn in company tax revenue, and Queensland and NSW cashing in on booming coal royalties.

After Jim Chalmers announced a second budget surplus anchored by strong mining exports and commodity prices, an EY royalty and company tax payments report, released on Monday, reveals miners have paid governments almost $360bn in taxes and royalties over a decade.

With Peter Dutton promising a Coalition government will adopt a “pro-mining mindset” and the Greens demanding an end to coal and gas, Anthony Albanese is under pressure to balance Labor’s emissions reduction ambitions with support for traditional mining.

Commissioned by the Minerals Council of Australia, whose members include BHP, Rio Tinto, Lynas Rare Earths, Glencore and Peabody, the annual report shows a $9.3bn increase in payments to governments. The $74bn payday for governments in 2022-23 included a decade-high $31.5bn in royalties. As well as traditional mining revenue associated with iron ore and coal, The Australian this month revealed oil and gas companies are on track to pay a record $17.1bn in taxes and royalties across 2023-24.

With the mining industry paying the highest average wages, contributing the most company taxes and delivering the bulk of export revenue, MCA chief executive Tania Constable warned against holding back miners with “draconian 1970s industrial relations agendas, high energy, environmental, planning and taxation costs”. The MCA will launch a national advertising blitz on Monday.
“The recent federal budget revealed that government spending is on the rise and it is our country’s mining sector that foots the bill, paying more than half of the company tax paid by large corporations and international businesses,” Ms Constable told The Australian.

“Despite underwriting our nation’s prosperity, living standards and security, the path forward for the mining industry remains uncertain. Our tax system is increasingly uncompetitive, and our regulatory environment is becoming more cumbersome.

“Approvals are taking too long, tied up in endless red tape, well-funded lawfare and multi-layered government bureaucracy, wasting taxpayers’ money and holding back Australia’s economy from realising its full potential.”

Queensland’s share of national royalty payments increased from 32.5 to 47.2 per cent off the back of higher coal royalty rates, with NSW claiming a $4.7bn royalties windfall. In the battleground election state of Western Australia, iron ore remained the biggest earner despite lower revenue and prices in 2022-23.

“Total mineral sector royalties reached approximately $31.5bn in 2022-23, increasing by $7.6bn from the previous year. The yearly growth in royalties was primarily due to an increase of $7.1bn in royalty taxes paid in Queensland due to the introduction of progressive coal royalty rates,” the EY report said.

“Western Australia’s royalty income is largely attributed to iron ore. In 2022-23, iron ore production volumes were similar to 2021-22, so changes in WA’s royalties were largely driven by changes in iron ore prices.

“Iron ore prices declined in the second quarter of 2022-23 and remained lower in early 2023 due to production restrictions in China.”

With mining companies and associated supply chains supporting 1.1 million jobs, Ms Constable said the sector was helping keep “Australia solvent”.

“A robust mining sector is critical if we want to sustain public spending, advance Australia’s broader economic agenda, and keep the budget in the black,” she said. “This is revenue that supports families, builds communities, and funds essential services like the NDIS, childcare subsidies and aged care.”.

The mining industry has warned the Prime Minister that at a time of “decaying productivity and looming long-term structural fiscal deficits, the government is imposing regressive policies on the sector that dampen the investment growth critical to achieving economic potential”.

Less than a year out from the election, Mr Albanese and Mr Dutton will ramp up campaigning in the resources-rich jurisdictions of WA and Queensland and the Northern Territory.

While Mr Albanese has used his Future Made in Australia policy to support critical minerals, Mr Dutton promised in his budget reply to cut red tape and rollback Labor’s sweeping IR reforms.",0,paywall

1d5rzal,"Why would it be a career ender or even embarassing when it's a fake? The ability to create fakes makes it even more likely that what you see is a fake since it is easier to produce.

Since the only connection with a person is generally the face and people aren't usually embarassed or career ending because of an image of their face being distributed, then the known presence of fakes means the rest of the image, which is the part that ties it to being porn, is questionable. It's like an allegation that has no supporting evidence or a joke that has multiple interpretations.

Really, I don't understand this paranoia over unsupported allegations unless society is now accepting unsupported allegations as truth and punishing on the basis of guilty until proven innocent.

The prevalence of fakes and misinformation simply means you can't trust what you are superficially presented with and thus your own response to that material is questionable: you have to work harder to find the truth in order to react reasonably, or just dismiss it all as propaganda and not react, unless you like the sound of your own subjective emotions dribbling out of your mouth without any objective basis.

The purpose of porn is to sexually excite and usually it exaggerates the characteristics that facilitate that. Even if deepfake porn is produced, it's likely to accentuate a persons sexual characteristics, so once again, I'm unsure how that is such an objectively harmful thing to go all prohibition era on if you do accept the authenticity of deep fakes or if you reject them as fakes.

It's easier for someone to ignore criticism and judgement than it is to force everyone not to criticise or judge.

The issue with deepfake porn is one of subjective emotional responses that needs to be moderated with reason, rather than objective harms that usually involve physical action against someone: subjective hurt feelings are not necessarily objective harms and everything tends to impact on our subjective emotions, so should we attempt to address everything in the world that results in hurt feelings or reduce the complexity down to addressing objective harms that might even be practical? Objective harms themself must be triaged because we don't have enough resources to manage them completely, let alone adding subjective hurt feelings to the burden creating an even longer list.

Subjective emotions are at the heart of many of the laws being crafted today, particularly fear and paranoia, yet government is using fear as a deterrent in an attempt to suppress the distribution of material that it says leads to fear. How can the use of fear be wrong in the distribution of deep fake porn but right in the methods used to suppress it?

Heck, if the government hasn't fucked everyone decades ago by selling off energy generation to the private industry, we could tempt manufacturing here by offering hugely discounted power pricing.

Never happened because of party politics. Decades of liberal scare campaign, ads showing the poor miners losing their jobs.

Basically, the tech exists to make the switch, thermal storage works great for overnight power. But the rich and powerful have easy access to politicians, so much so that the opposition leader took a flight across the country to spend 3 hours at a party with the human parasite known as Gina.
So we never got any traction in making these changes.

Firstly is bribes for state governments to loosen zoning restrictions. Unlike many here, I question how effective this will be to solve the crisis.

Secondly would be the classic housing subsidy program. The sort of thing we’ve seen fail again and again. 

Thirdly would be social housing spending. Which would ‘merely’ move to slowly and slightly solve the housing crisis of rental costs of the bottom 10% of households.

1cupgad,"Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has shelved indefinitely plans to repatriate about 40 Australian women and children currently stranded in detention camps managed by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.

Two senior government sources with direct knowledge of the issue told *The Saturday Paper* that while the government had not formally decided against repatriating the so-called ISIS brides and their children, the prime minister had made it “very clear” that unless there was a dramatic deterioration in the security situation in and around the camps, the issue “would not be revisited before the election”.

“Not bringing these women and children who are Australian citizens home is nothing other than a complete failure of political will,” says Save the Children Australia chief executive Mat Tinkler. “That and nothing else.”

Most of the 40 people are detained in Al Roj camp near the Turkish border and have been interviewed in person by Australian security officials. Four people detained in Al Hol detention camp further south have not been interviewed due to its inaccessibility to Australian officials.

Save the Children Australia is currently attempting to compel the Australian government to repatriate a group of the detainees in Syria via a writ of habeas corpus.

In November last year, Federal Court Justice Mark Moshinsky dismissed Save the Children’s application on the grounds the detention of the women and children was not under the control of the Commonwealth. Last week the full bench of the Federal Court heard an appeal from Save the Children to overturn Justice Moshinsky’s ruling.

“Australian citizenship has to mean something,” says Tinkler. “Being a child has to mean something too. And if our government cannot move to help a group of Australian women and their children from one of the worst places on Earth, then what does it actually mean to be an Australian citizen?”

In a supporting affidavit to the Federal Court, Greg Barton, professor of global Islamic politics at Deakin University, said the Australian government faced no practical barrier from the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES), or from current circumstances on the ground, to repatriate Australian women and children.

“AANES, together with the United States, desperately wants the current very slow pace of repatriation to be substantially accelerated. There are no recorded incidents of repatriation being refused,” Barton said.

In 2019, then Liberal prime minister Scott Morrison authorised the repatriation of eight Australian children from a Syrian detention camp. Many of those who lobbied on behalf of detainees in the country believe that, had it not been for the Covid-19 pandemic, Morrison would have repatriated all the Australian women and children.

In October 2022, Labor’s Home Affairs minister, Clare O’Neil, announced a group of four Australian women and their 13 Australian children had been repatriated from Al Roj camp to their families in New South Wales, mostly in Western Sydney.

Last week one of those women, Mariam Raad, 32, pleaded guilty to willingly entering a Syrian region controlled by Islamic State, a terrorist organisation.

Raad, who is on bail, will be sentenced next month and faces a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison. She is the only person among the 17 people repatriated in October 2022 to face court.

Kamalle Dabboussy, chief executive of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils (AFIC), says the 17 who were repatriated in October 2022 have comfortably settled back into their home communities in Sydney. He led a public campaign for his daughter Mariam Dabboussy’s return to Australia and remains a strong advocate for the repatriation of those who remain in north-east Syria.

“It wasn’t a headache, I can take a Panadol for that. It was a fucking migraine, a big ugly stain on the blue carpet that spread all the way around to the prime minister’s office, and the pain of it hasn’t gone away.”

“They are getting on with their lives, getting engaged with their communities, playing sports, and as far as national security goes, they’re doing exactly what they said they would do, which is cooperate with Australian authorities,” says Dabboussy.",0,prime minister anthony albanese shell indefinitely plan repatriate australian woman child currently strange detention camp manage autonomous

1ctv2cf,"Two in three dollars allocated to new road and rail projects in Tuesday’s budget went to Labor held electorates, sparking hypocrisy claims from the Coalition. Labor allocated $4.1 billion for 64 new priority infrastructure projects, $2.7 billion of which went to Labor seats, according to analysis of Infrastructure Department data by The Australian Financial Review.

Labor stashes away billions for road and rail projects in its own seats. Sydney Morning Herald The money for new projects was in addition to $10.1 billion over 10 years towards dozens of projects already being jointly funded with the states. The bulk of the new money, about $1.9 billion, went to 14 new projects in western Sydney. Among the cash splash was $115 million for upgrades to Mulgoa Road in the Liberal held marginal seat of Lindsay. A version of the same project was axed by Infrastructure Minister Catherine King six months ago in response to the review of the $120 billion 10-year Infrastructure Investment Pipeline.

Advertisement Overall, NSW got $2.5 billion for 23 new road and rail projects with $1.85 billion allocated to Labor seats. About $340 million was given to Coalition seats and $215 million for projects that run over multiple, mixed electorates. Queensland was allocated three new projects worth $192 million. The bulk of that went to the Labor seat of Blair for two highway upgrades worth $177 million. A further $15 million was allocated to the Liberal seat of Petrie.

Infrastructure Minister Catherine King said the government had worked closely with the states and territories to invest in the projects that needed money the most, and were guided by them to assess priority. “The majority of our investments in this budget went to ensure existing projects can be delivered, as well as in fast-growing areas like western Sydney and south-east Queensland,” Ms King told the Financial Review. “The Commonwealth cannot deliver projects that the states and territories are not supportive of. We saw the outcome of this with the Liberals and Nationals announcing project after project that were never delivered.” Just over half new projects were in Labor seats, though almost half of those – 14 small projects worth about $444 million – were in the Northern Territory where the party holds both federal lower house seats. The Territory’s election is scheduled for August this year. In Tasmania, three out of six new projects were in Labor seats and received the bulk of new money – about $120 million of the $171 million, which was largely for upgrades to the Lyell and Huon highways. Big winner A further $47 million went to transport projects in the seat of Clark around Hobart where independent Andrew Wilkie is the local MP. Victoria received just over $17.6 million for three new projects, all of which were in Coalition seats, but was ultimately the big infrastructure winner in the budget, receiving $5 billion for 27 existing projects. That commitment means Victoria received the largest share of new money allocated to the 10-year $120 billion Infrastructure Investment Program in Treasurer Jim Chalmers’ third budget, almost $2 billion more than NSW. There is also $1.8 billion still unallocated in NSW, with many new projects currently in the planning phase, and anticipated to move to construction phase in the near future. Across new and existing projects, Queensland was allocated $2.5 billion, while Western Australia received $2.3 billion, about 75 per cent of which was for WA Labor’s signature Metronet train network. South Australia got $160 million for seven new projects, just $5 million of which went to Labor seats. The bulk of the money – about $136 million – went to two road projects in the independent seat of Mayo. Shadow Infrastructure Minister Bridget McKenzie accused Labor of using the budget to “bail out” Labor premiers and satiate local Labor MPs. “It should have focussed on giving the Reserve Bank of Australia confidence in their fiscal approach, so interest rates can be reduced and cost of living pressures relieved,” Senator McKenzie said. “This government spreadsheet has only one colour, and it’s a sea of red.” stashes away billions for road and rail project announcements ahead of federal election.",1,two three dollar allocate new road rail project tuesday budget go labor hold electorate

Plumbers, bricklayers, cabinetmakers and other tradespeople needed to tackle Australia’s housing crisis have not yet made the cut on the federal government’s list of core occupations for its new skills-in-demand visa, despite pleas from the construction industry to make it easier to recruit from overseas.

As part of the government’s December 2023 migration strategy, which aims to halve net migration from 510,000 within two years, Jobs and Skills Australia has been asked to categorise occupations that will be eligible for the “core skills occupations list”.

Under the current draft, tradespeople including bricklayers, painters, roof tilers, stonemasons and cabinetmakers are listed as “targeted for consultation”, rather than guaranteed a spot on the core skills list.

A case will have to be made for these occupations to be included, which Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn said was “bizarre” given the industry’s “mammoth task” of building 1.2 million homes by 2029.

In a submission to Jobs and Skills Australia, Master Builders argues that to exclude any trade or trade-related profession in building and construction at a time of critical workforce shortages “would be a failure”.

“Given the industry is facing chronic labour shortages across all occupation groups and has a mammoth task of building 1.2 million homes with supporting infrastructure, all building and construction trades and related occupations must be included on the list,” Wawn said on Tuesday.

“Bricklayers, cabinetmakers, stonemasons, painters, plasterers and roof tilers are all in shortage but have all been put on the ‘maybe’ list. If we are going to have any chance of addressing the housing crisis, this needs to change.”

A spokesperson for Skills and Training Minister Brendan O’Connor said Jobs and Skills Australia was an independent agency and was still in the consultation process to determine which occupations would be on the final “core skills occupations list”.

“Jobs and Skills Australia will provide advice to the government on the core skills occupations list later this year,” the spokesperson said.

Home Affairs Minister Clare O’Neil and Immigration Minister Andrew Giles retain decision-making power on the final list of trades eligible for the new visa, which will allow migrants to fill areas of skills shortage, as long as they have guaranteed annual earnings of at least $70,000, indexed annually. Successful applicants could have their visas approved in 21 days, and have their length of stay doubled to four years, with potential for permanent residency.

Coalition skills and training spokeswoman Sussan Ley accused the government of contributing to the construction shortfall.

“\[Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s\] failed energy and industrial relations policies were already making it harder than ever for the construction industry to build the homes Australians need, and now we see him making it even worse,” she said.

“There is a clear contrast between the Coalition, who as \[Opposition Leader\] Peter Dutton said in the budget reply, will place tradies who can build homes at the front of the queue, versus Anthony Albanese who is busy kicking them out of the queue.”

Earlier this month, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council’s State of the Housing System 2024 report found the government’s target of building 1.2 million homes by 2029 would fall short by more than 250,000 due to building industry constraints, complex planning processes and lack of land.

In December, O’Neil said migrant tradies would be considered under the core skills program, but “we need to make sure it is not a free-for-all with unintended consequences for Aussies doing apprenticeships”.

However, the federal government is also under pressure to cut immigration, with the May budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to 395,000 this financial year and 260,000 next year and 255,000 in the subsequent year.",0,paywall plumber bricklayer cabinetmaker tradespeople need tackle australia housing crisis not yet make cut federal government list core occupation new skillindemand

Her statement is below to save you a click:

**Statement by Laura Tingle, 7.30 Chief Political Correspondent**

For much of the past two weeks, the political debate has focused not on the federal Budget but on the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply in which he pledged to cut migration to deal with the housing crisis.

I have written and broadcast on this decision and its implications on ABC platforms numerous times since then. I was also a panellist at the Sydney Writers' Festival on the weekend when migration and housing were also discussed in a panel on the year in politics.

In my writing and broadcasts over the past two weeks I have observed on several occasions that there were considerable dangers for the way our political discourse would unfold – and for social harmony – in linking migration to the housing crisis.

At the Writers' Festival I was asked to comment on the Opposition leader's policy on migration and the economy, including housing. Mr Dutton has been vocal on this topic, particularly over the past fortnight.

""It's not just housing,"" he said. ""People know that if you move suburbs it's hard to get your kids into school or into childcare. It's hard to get into a GP because the doctors have closed their books. It's hard to get elective surgery. These factors have all contributed to capacity constraints because of the lack of planning in the migration program.""

He has also said migrants are the cause of ""congestion on our roads"".

As the alternative Prime Minister, with an election approaching within a year, Mr Dutton's comments deserve rigorous scrutiny and examination.

I have also pointed out that there were flaws in the Opposition's position as a piece of viable policy. That is, while on the face of it an obvious answer to a shortage of housing might be to immediately try to cut the number of people seeking it – and the obvious answer there is migrants – things are actually a lot more complicated when you try to do that.

The Morrison government announced an almost identical cut in permanent migration numbers in the 2019 Budget, saying the ""planning level of the Migration Program will be reduced from 190,000 to 160,000 places for four years from 2019-20"". The pandemic rather disrupted that plan.

But the very same 2019 budget papers were forecasting that net overseas migration would be 271,700 in 2019 before dropping to just 263,800 three years later in 2022, despite the cut of 30,000 permanent places a year.

A big reason for the fact that net overseas migration was not forecast to fall, despite the cut in the permanent number, is that more than half the people who are accepted as permanent migrants are already here when they apply. So cutting permanent migration doesn't necessarily mean fewer people in, or coming to, the country. Some of the migration pool just changes ""class"". Others are still able to come here on temporary visas.

There has also been confusion about whether the Coalition planned to cut the (relatively small) permanent migration number, or to cut back the much larger, demand-driven net overseas migration number, which includes programs that have no formal caps and includes overseas students.

Shadow Treasurer Angus Taylor added to that confusion last week when he said the plan was to cut net overseas migration by 25 per cent, not just permanent migration. Mr Taylor also accused Labor of using migration to prop up the economy – and it is true that the post-pandemic surge in returning temporary visa holders has indeed played a crucial role in keeping a barely simmering economy from dropping into recession. But that raises the question of what happens if you cut migration as dramatically as the Coalition appears to want to do.

Discussions at writers' festivals are much less formal and more free-flowing than a piece of analysis on an ABC platform and this was a format where adding detailed context to the discussion wasn't really possible.

Panellist Niki Savva had quoted those points Mr Dutton had made about too many migrants meaning things like it was too hard to buy a house, get in to see your GP, or get into childcare, and noted that the Opposition Leader seemed to bring everything back to immigration.

In agreeing with that observation, based on Mr Dutton's own quotes, I once again raised the risks for the political debate of a major political leader doing this, which I truncated as ""everything that's going wrong in this country is because of migrants"".

That was simply a result of trying to summarise a point in a much less structured forum and was not intended to imply he had said that verbatim. If I had been speaking on an ABC platform, or not in a five-way discussion, I would have provided all that context, as I do in my stories for the ABC.

I did indeed make the observation on Sunday that we are a racist country, in the context of a discussion about the political prospects ahead. I wasn't saying every Australian is a racist. But we clearly have an issue with racism. For some months now, for example, The Australian newspaper has been devoting considerable space to its alarm about a rise in anti-Semitism in Australia.

Without even going into the historic record, there is also ample evidence that racism remains a particular problem in our legal and policing systems. A coronial inquest underway in the Northern Territory has become mired in an expose of racism in the NT's elite policing unit. Racism and racial profiling repeatedly show up as an issue of concern in our policing and justice systems.

The morning radio news bulletins on the ABC on Monday featured several stories that were related to racism, including one about racial profiling of young South Sudanese men in a police presentation to legal practitioners in Melbourne.

Surveys, including by the ABC, have repeatedly found the majority of Australians of non-European backgrounds reporting experiences of discrimination and racism in their lives, sometimes starting as early as primary school.

Is it relevant to raise this record of Australian racism in political analysis? Absolutely, if it becomes an issue of controversy in our political contest – as it clearly did when Pauline Hanson appeared on the national stage in 1996 and declared the country was being ""swamped with Asians"". John Howard had similarly flirted with the issue of Asian immigration in the 1980s and Julia Gillard did too in 2013 when she used a speech on a visit to western Sydney to announce a clampdown on the issue of temporary skilled worker visas.

In my commentary at the ABC, and at the Sydney Writers' Festival, I expressed my concern at the risks involved in Peter Dutton pressing the hot button of housing and linking it to migration for these reasons.

Political leaders, by their comments, give licence to others to express opinions they may not otherwise express.

That does not make them racist.

But it has real world implications for many Australians.

Finally, panellists were asked to nominate a positive change that had come from the change of government, on the basis of the famous quote that ""when you change the government, you change the country"".

Not having the time in that setting to attempt a detailed and serious assessment of what has changed with the change of government, I made an off-hand observation that simply observed we now had fewer stunts like the ""needles in strawberries"" affair and that, whatever its failings, the current government seemed serious about policy.

I regret that when I was making these observations at the Writers' Festival the nature of the free-flowing panel discussion means they were not surrounded by every quote substantiating them which would have – and had – been included in what I had said earlier on the ABC.

This has created the opportunity for yet another anti-ABC pile-on.

This is not helpful to me or to the ABC. Or to the national debate

I am proud of my work as a journalist at the ABC, on all its platforms, and I let that work speak for itself.

It is based, always, on solid research and a lifetime of experience reporting on Australian politics.

That work is built on, and delivered in, the framework of the ABC's very high editorial standards.",0,mode somewhat alter title provide context originally post abc medium centre laura tingle statement

It doesn't get better because most of us still miss the thing we need most- community, real community. Here's another perspective and a blunt one: I have it 'all', a 3mil house with no debt, I run a business that I only work 5 hrs on per week, I have a great husband and two beautiful sons. We just built a new house, our dream house. It's still the same feeling I had when I was 18 and had nothing. I have dreams, but they're never as good as I think they are when I reach them, because they're all surface; buy a house, run a business. The dream for me is not to sit in a house, without community. And it took me 10 years and money to realise that I'm deeply bored and unhappy. Nothing really excites me, except my kids milestones and smiles. How is that doing anything for the world? Just sitting here unhappy making money for the government in my secure safe little box. The more I think about it the worse it gets. I think most people hit this realisation ar a certain age and you only have a choice to keep at it or fuck it all off.

So we are selling our home and business this year, travelling to poorer countries, helping how we can, and experiencing life outside of the box. I feel SO MUCH better, SO relieved that there's 'more'. I'm actually elated, I rarely had that feeling anymore for years.

What I'm getting at is, it's unlikely a job and house and family will make you feel better. Assuming you're not depressed, just stuck in the cycle.

The polarisation of this issue which is a pattern of the extreme left is that you either adopt our language, narrative and facts or you are against us.

The different between Israel and other conflicts is that there is nuance and multiple truths can exist at the same time. Israel can be committing war crimes but Israel also has a right to defend itself. I don’t recall in previous wars people asking for countries to be dissolved, I don’t recall in previous protests individuals getting targeted and harassed with affiliation to the country regardless of their politic view point. 
There is something far more divisive and violent in these style of protests which seems different to others and one needs to ask the question especially since we are dealing with students and education is what is the impact of social media, foreign influence and other factors to drive polarisation.
This isn’t tin foil hat land, we have clear evidence of this taking place in the US.

I'm not sure that there are many extra responsibilities I can take on. I've worked for my current company for over half my working life and I've worked in every department, including a stint as a supervisor that lasted for just over a year. 

I love to learn new things, and I think that's part of the reason I'm so desperate to get out, I feel like I've hit a brick wall of all that I can learn. That and the managers are kinda impossible to deal with currently. This is also combined with how shitty people are post COVID. Which is why I don't want to just get a similar job in another company. I want to get out of retail all together.

Working in the companies head office would be ideal as it's a part of the company I haven't worked in yet, but unfortunately it's located in Melbourne. 

I've got a mortgage that I share with someone and am responsible for helping take care of an elderly family member. So relocating is not possible with my current circumstances.

My brother says my issue is that I don't talk up the skills I have enough, and your reply kinda reinforced that that is something that is definitely needed.

1. Getting planning approvals doesn't nessecaily mean they are in the position to build. They often do this to increase the value of their equality to borrow again to to upsell. Both of which maximise their profit.

3. If material costs are high but appear to be dropping they will hold back their development to maximise their profit.


Councils approving more planning and building permits isn't the only thing they can do to increase supply. 

They have the power to produce proposals to rezone land in their municipality to get approved by the planning minister.

1d1s7yi,"The Space Shuttle was dealing with ordinary physical problems like two pipes making a good seal with each-other, and the fact that hydrogen atoms are so small they will actually leak out through a crystalline metal structure. That's physics.

No, we cannot make electrolysis more efficient than 1.6 units of electricity producing 1 unit of stored hydrogen energy.

* It requires 237kJ/mol to disassociate H2O into H2 and O2. \[ That's the absolute theoretical minimum. 
* Burning hydrogen with oxygen releases 286kj/mol of heat energy \[ 
* Thus, the theoretical maximum is requiring 1.2 units of electricity to produce 1 unit of stored hydrogen energy
* In practice, as the water electrolysis article will demonstrate, and the simple fact that heat engines are never 100% efficient (or we'd have 250% more energy from coal and gas-fired power stations than we do now), if we get 1.6:1 we're doing well.
* This ratio inevitably becomes worse because it requires energy to pressurise and refrigerate the hydrogen, since this requires 50kj/mol \[
* and liquid hydrogen boils off during storage at a rate of 1-5%/day \[ibid\]

Again, it only makes energy sense if we have a massive surplus of renewable energy. But then if we have a massive surplus of renewable energy we don't need to store it, and don't have to store it in hydrogen or batteries, we can just waste it - unplug the solar PV, let the wind turbines spin without turning the turbines, and so on.
