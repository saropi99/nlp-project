The plan itself, to send them to another country for processing isn't actually illegal so they should be able to find a safe country to do this.

Simply declaring Rwanda officially safe is insane, particularly as there are Rwandan refugees fleeing from Rwanda who have applied for asylum in the UK.

The Home office won't talk about this, but i suspect that the finances won't stand up for scrutiny and i suspect that the UK taxpayer has financed those Rwandan homes their government is currently selling off that Cruella Slaverman admired so much.

Rwanda is yet another black hole for taxpayer's money and the National Debt is about to hit £3 trillion. (£3,000,000,000,000).
It was about £1.1 trillion in 2010 when they took over.

1d5o3mj,"There are 2 doctors in my surgery to cover over 8000 people and I feel that this understaffing played a part in my mum's death.   
My mum wasn't a well woman, she had MS and was bed bound, had carers coming in to see her 4 times a day and after my dad passed in November the rest of the time it was just me to take care of her and I failed her. For the last few months of her life she had constant UTI's and was in a constant state of confusion with them. No doctor came out to see her despite my having to phone the practice every other week and a couple of times an advanced nurse practitioner came out. One morning I had to phone 999 as I couldn't get her to wake and ended up having to perform chest compressions on her. Long story short I had to leave her after a few hours as my sister was taken into hospital that same day and almost passed that night due to sepsis. I thought I was leaving her in good hands and I needed to help my brother in law with my nephews. Anyhoo 6 hours after being taken she was discharged. A subsequent conversation with the advanced nurse practitioner as my mum was found eating tissue paper I mentioned she had just been in hospital and this practitioner said she wouldn't have been discharged if there was anything wrong and asked me if I wanted her in hospital. I said I just wanted what was best for my mum.

I have no doubt that libs will chart housing starts and show their time in office where they grew to levels never seen during covid then showing under labor that they have reduced. Ie building volumes are reducing under labor. At the same time as massive population growth.

The reasons for the collapse are higher costs of construction and liberals new home grant at the tail end of their time in office but labor have done nothing material to change this. 

Ie we are starting less homes when we have a government that tells us they are addressing supply. 

So labor talk about supply more than liberals but the results are shit. Maybe not their fault but they certainly could do things that address this. Things they are not doing. 

Sure they can promise after their first term they will eventually reach their 1.2million homes but this will fall flat when for the entirity of their term demand has exceeded supply and rents have spiked.

That's a tough one. It's incredibly difficult to judge how strong someone is, mentally. And I'm not a psychiatrist, so there's no fucking way I'm going to trust my own judgement.

My advice is that — don't rely on your own judgement. Because this is too important to get wrong.

It's also hard to know if you should have a word with his superiors or not — your colleague would have done that themselves if they wanted to.

Having said that, as someone who is a manager, I would absolutely want to know that one of my employees is working too much. I don't really know how hard someone is working unless I'm closely supervising them... and frankly I don't have time to do that. I've got too many people under me. I rely on people telling me if they need to be given a lighter workload.

The analogy I'd use is looking at someone carrying a cardboard box. What's in the box? It could be an empty box or full of lead weights. How could I ever know? You need to tell me. I sure as heck don't want the person carrying the box to hurt themselves and need back surgery.

I didn't own the truck obviously. I'm just a guy working towards my truck license. I'm also not a youngster - just decided I'd like to have a truck license since occasionally I've wished I had one.

Honestly, I'd expect someone young to be the most likely to actually have a use for a big truck. They almost certainly don't have enough disposable income have a vehicle like that just because it looks cool. Some people do put cargo in the back of their truck regularly. And those big RAMS can carry a lot more weight than a 2WD Hilux.

I've driven a 2WD hilux fully loaded with a trailer... it was not fun. I had the accelerator pedal on the floor for about an hour and even down hill it only reached 90km/h - the wind resistance alone was more than the tiny motor could handle, let alone the weight — which would've been about half a ton in the tray and another ton on the trailer. It was safe, the suspension and brakes could totally handle the weight. But the motor? Fuck me that thing wasn't good enough. Also that one hour drive used half a tank of petrol — motors are only efficient when they're not working too hard.

The fallout from Direction 99 comes amid ongoing scrutiny of Mr Giles and the Albanese ­government’s handling of the 152 people released from indefinite detention following a High Court decision late last year. Several of those individuals have since been arrested on fresh offences.

Opposition immigration spokesman Dan Tehan said it was clear that Direction 99 was having an impact on community safety.
“Andrew Giles needs to explain why he won’t change this direction and why he won’t change it immediately,” Mr Tehan said.
“What this clearly shows is that your ties to Australia are given primacy over everything else. No matter how Andrew Giles tries to spin it, he is endangering the Australian community through the changes he made. Once again, this is a complete mess of the minister’s own making.”

Mr Giles said this week he was seeking urgent advice in relation to Saki, and criticised the AAT’s decision to reinstate Saki’s visa as “inconsistent” with Direction 99.

Asked on Friday about the number of visa reinstatements that had relied on Direction 99, a spokesman for Mr Giles said the direction placed a “significant ­emphasis on serious offending and family violence – which need to be considered in all matters”.",0,senior member chris burnwell say man case finely balance protect australian community consideration include tie australia mr burnwell ultimately often cancel revolution man isa ballot direction come amid go scrutiny mr mile albanese government handling people release indefinite detention follow high court decision late last year several individual since arrest fresh offence opposition immigration spokesman dan say clear direction impact community safety andrew mile need explain not change direction not change immediately mr say clearly show tie australia give primacy everything else no matter andrew mile try spin endanger australian community change make complete mess minister making mr mile say week seek urgent advice relation sake criticize decision reinstate sake isa inconsistent direction ask friday number isa reinstatement rely direction spokesman mr mile say direction place significant emphasis serious offend family violence need consider matter,"['senior', 'member', 'chris', 'burnwell', 'say', 'man', 'case', 'finely', 'balance', 'protect', 'australian', 'community', 'consideration', 'include', 'tie', 'australia', 'mr', 'burnwell', 'ultimately', 'often', 'cancel', 'revolution', 'man', 'isa', 'ballot', 'direction', 'come', 'amid', 'go', 'scrutiny', 'mr', 'mile', 'albanese', 'government', 'handling', 'people', 'release', 'indefinite', 'detention', 'follow', 'high', 'court', 'decision', 'late', 'last', 'year', 'several', 'individual', 'since', 'arrest', 'fresh', 'offence', 'opposition', 'immigration', 'spokesman', 'dan', 'say', 'clear', 'direction', 'impact', 'community', 'safety', 'andrew', 'mile', 'need', 'explain', 'not', 'change', 'direction', 'not', 'change', 'immediately', 'mr', 'say', 'clearly', 'show', 'tie', 'australia', 'give', 'primacy', 'everything', 'else', 'no', 'matter', 'andrew', 'mile', 'try', 'spin', 'endanger', 'australian', 'community', 'change', 'make', 'complete', 'mess', 'minister', 'making', 'mr', 'mile', 'say', 'week', 'seek', 'urgent', 'advice', 'relation', 'sake', 'criticize', 'decision', 'reinstate', 'sake', 'isa', 'inconsistent', 'direction', 'ask', 'friday', 'number', 'isa', 'reinstatement', 'rely', 'direction', 'spokesman', 'mr', 'mile', 'say', 'direction', 'place', 'significant', 'emphasis', 'serious', 'offend', 'family', 'violence', 'need', 'consider', 'matter']"

Our Company Income Tax rate is higher than the average rate in all regions (with the average in our region being 19.8%) and if we are truly concerned with productivity, this is where we start. 

But, whilst the highest marginal tax rate is 45%, a reduction in the corporate rate encourages further tax rate arbitrage, particularly in personal services income fields. 

Had we proceeded with S3TC as we should have, lowering the top rates and pushing 30% out to 2x average would have removed this incentive totally and would have allowed us to lower company tax rates to attract investment and unlock productivity.

During my recent visit, I embarked on a culinary journey that left me both satisfied and impressed. Upon entering the cozy ambiance of Chikaros, I was greeted by the aroma of spices and the welcoming smiles of the staff. The menu, boasting an array of enticing options, immediately caught my attention. From traditional classics to innovative creations, there was something to please every taste bud. I opted for the Chef Kebabish, a delightful combination of succulent meats grilled to perfection and infused with aromatic spices. Each bite was a symphony of flavors, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs. The tender meat paired beautifully with the accompanying sauces, creating a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes. Equally impressive was the Classic Parmesan, a timeless favorite elevated to new heights at Chikaros. The crispy coating gave way to a tender chicken breast, smothered in rich marinara sauce and gooey melted cheese. It was a comforting indulgence that left me craving more. However, despite the culinary delights, I was disappointed to discover that Chikaros does not accept card payments. While this may not deter cash-carrying patrons, it poses an inconvenience for those accustomed to the convenience of card transactions. It's a small hiccup in an otherwise stellar dining experience but one worth noting nonetheless. Overall, my experience at Chikaros was nothing short of exceptional.

The first thing I noticed was the pizza had not been overcooked. The crust golden, like it had been soaking in the rays on a picturesque Caribbean beach. Perfectly moist and spongy as one would expect. Secondly, the cheese was there. Usually I am second guessing myself, wondering if I had accidentally clicked the' Extra Dough' option when ordering, rather than extra cheese. This time it had visibly slid across the surface of the pizza in transit due to the sheer weight and consistency-something that I wo n't deduct points for. Anyway, having a few slices with a bit less cheese, knowing you are going to reach those absolutely coated came as quite an exciting and almost tense ordeal. The sauce was plenty ladled, and because the pizza was n't overcooked, the toppings were juicy and tender. Remember, if we want pepperoni crisps we will just buy them from the shop.

1.171742907e+20,"Positives: First time going to this place today. Let me tell you, coming from a family of chefs this was delectable, the dine in meals came out fast, they were LARGE portions, and very good temperature. We ordered the flowered onion( fried and whole), we ordered the Louisiana chook both entrees. Then I had the parmigiana as my main with mash and veg. The mash and veg was perfectly cooked, though the mash tastes a little like packet mash. The sauce with the Louisiana chicken is a little spicy so if you ca n’t tolerate a little spice the sauce is n’t for you. But man oh man the crunch on the chook and the juicy chicken was incredible, was thoroughly enjoyable. The parmigiana was LARGE so much so I could n’t finish it all. Great that they gave takeaways Negatives: The drink I ordered was the summer one in the mocktails section, tasted great only issue I really had was the lemon seeds in the drink, lucky the straws were n’t big enough to suck them up otherwise we would had an issue trying to fish multiple seeds out of the drink. We loved the Louisiana chicken so much we ordered some to take away, sadly to our disappointment the portion sizes were very different, much smaller and not as crunchy still very tasty and very juicy just not the same portion sizes as dine in( specifically regarding our dining experience) We also ordered take away chocolate churro and fruit fondu. The Churros are Exquisite as far as crunch goes but there is little to no cinnamon sugar on it. But the lack of cinnamon sugar can be covered up by the chocolate sauce and fruit eaten together bite by bite. The sauce also tasted Store bought which is still tasted good to me but may not be to everyone liking. The flowered onion, leaves much to be desired for, I definitely would n’t eat it by itself as it essentially just a whole onion fried up. The sauce was nice and it goes well with the main meal. Other: I must say they brought the mains out not long after we got our entrees which is okay. Just did n’t really get time to savour the entrees. The serves seems a little all over the place but generally very welcoming and accomodating.

1d4yqpb,"I think you are confusing an Israeli based ""private"" firm selling its targeted political campaigning services with an Israeli govt agency working only for themselves. The former is not limited to just Israel for their clients, or certain type of clients. Hence, the weird combination of their clientele.

Israel has several ""private"" companies offering targeted services for/against high value targets, which are deployed even by several foreign government agencies/clients.

Pegasus by NSO, Cambridge Analytica started by those EX-Israeli special forces etc. were used by all kinds of clients across the political spectrum. Some cross the line at some point, and then they get shut down, and a new one takes its place. For example, Cambridge Analytica came down tumbling by interfering in US elections, but they were doing very well when they were doing the same thing all over the world before that.

These ""private"" companies work for anyone who pays them well, and as long as they are useful in the long run for Israel/US, they seem to be allowed to operate with certain freedom on what they do, and who they target on a smaller scale. They might have a leash, but they also have a bit of room to play around, improve their techniques, and make money.

Served with coriander chutney, ketchup and potato wafers, the sandwich is liberally topped with sev, jeeravan, mayo and cheese. The perfect combination for Indori taste buds. In short, a plate of sandwich can easily suffice two. Trust me, it's true. For me, even finishing three pieces of the sandwich was difficult. So if you plan on having this sandwich, make sure you have ample space in your tummy and do n't plan to order anything else, because you wo n't be able to eat anything after the sandwich. With just 5 bench tables to sit on and 3-4 tiny tables to stand and eat, the shop offers a decent space to accommodate the customers. A lot of people opt for take away and you can do so if you do n't like sitting on the street side to eat. The best part, this enormous sandwich is priced at Rs 150 only and reaches you in just 10 mins. Is n't it wow! Light on your pocket and light on the wait time as well.
